 Jessie	Speaker	JessieHey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me?It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it together. I'll explain it to you.I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors... you know, flashy stuff.Okay, it's about to start.This is a complete model of the city of Midgar.It's about a 1/10000 scale.The top plate is about 50 meters above ground.A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and there are other support structures built in each section...psst... whisper... whisper (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was in the northern section.)Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor.The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity.Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them.Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's the kind of place this is.Phew..., this is next! Look.This is the route this train is on.The route spirals around the main support structure.We should be coming around the center area, right now.At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up.It can check the identities and backgrounds on each and every passenger on the train by linking it up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters.whisper... whisper... (Anyone could tell that we look suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)	Cloud	Referent
 Jessie	Speaker	JessieIt's me, Jessie. How do I look, Cloud?Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?	Cloud	Referent

 Cloud	Speaker	CloudI'm physically built like someone in SOLDIER.Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult.It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of SOLDIER.You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy.Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells......For better or worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER.It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion.But weak people...... like me, get lost in the whole thing.The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my own weakness are what created me.Everyone knew that. I'm...... Cloud.......the master of my own illusionary world.But I can't remain trapped in an illusion any more......I'm going to live my life without pretending.	Sephiroth	Referent

 Tifa	Speaker	TifaActually, it's been seven years.You got your wish and joined SOLDIER, quit after the Sephiroth incident, and now you're a mercenary...You told me a lot about what happened after you left Nibelheim...But......Something's wrong. I felt there was something strange about the things you talked about.All the things you didn't know that you should, And other things you shouldn't know that you did...I wanted to make sure...But then I heard... you were going far away...And I didn't want that......I didn't know what to do. So, I thought I needed more time.And that's why I told you about the AVALANCHE job. I wanted to be with you, watch you.	Sephiroth	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaWhat about Sephiroth?	Sephiroth	Referent

 Tifa	Speaker	TifaI don't care about anything else, only Cloud......I...... want to be by his side......	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	Tifa (after the North Corel mission)Cloud...... I don't understand a word he's saying......I'm such a fool...... I thought there was something that I could do for him......	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	Tifa (after the Fort Condor mission)......it's no use...... I don't understand a thing, Cloud.What should I do......? What if you never recover for the rest of your life?	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	Tifa (at the door)Cid......!? What's wrong?	Cid	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaThis is bad...... The tremors are getting worse.Wait a minute, Cloud.Doctor! Shouldn't we move him somewhere rather than stay here...?	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaDon't you worry about a thing, Cloud......I'll see to it that you get somewhere safe!	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaYes!Ready Cloud? We're leaving now!!	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaCloud, help me!!Eyaaaaghh......!!	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaIt connects...... to Nibelheim......?That's right... It's probably best to start from there......Let's go have a look, Cloud. I know it's not easy...... But I'll be right with you......	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaCloud... look.Here's the well...And that's Gramps' Inn, too.The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little kids, right?This is the Nibelheim you remember, right?It's the same as my Nibelheim. That's why this place is...... our Nibelheim.	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaFive Years ago... two men from SOLDIER came...Sephiroth and...... a young and vibrant soldier.Can you tell me again what happened?	Sephiroth	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaFive Years ago... I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first time.	Sephiroth	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaSo this is... the Great Sephiroth.	Sephiroth	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaNo, Cloud.I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you... something terrible might happen.But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore.	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaYou weren't here. Cloud did not come to Nibelheim five years ago.	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaI... waited. But, Cloud... never came.The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another person...	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaI... waited. But, Cloud... never came.The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another person...	Sephiroth	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaThere's nothing...... I can say......You must find the answer yourself......If you can't...... Then you......Take your time, Cloud. Slowly...... little by little, okay?	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaDon't hurry, Cloud...... Don't answer too quickly.Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come back...... Slowly...... little by little.......Right... like the sky that night...... the heavens were filled with stars......	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaTry and remember, Cloud.	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaCloud, what about your other memories?No, not memories.A memory is something that has to be consciously recalled, right?That's why sometimes it can be mistaken and a different thing......But it's different from a memory locked deep within your heart......That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that memory......That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me?I say something and you don't remember it......But you say something, and I remember it, too... Then we'll know that's our memory......Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you...Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the first place?I always thought it was a sudden decision you made......	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaYeah... it was so sudden. I was... a bit surprised.But...It's true that we weren't THAT close, but...After you left town, I really thought about you a lot.I used to wonder how Cloud was doing.I wonder if Cloud was able to get into SOLDIER?I started reading the newspapers, thinking that there might be an article about you.	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaSo that was it......Sorry, Cloud.If I had only remembered more clearly what happened, I could have done something sooner......	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaBut, I remember back when we were eight!That's it! Now I know!You weren't created five years ago.My childhood memories weren't all made up!Hang in there Cloud! Just a little longer! You've almost found the real you!Let's go back to Nibelheim again......!	Cloud	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaCloud, wait.Where are you going?	Cloud	Referent

 Tifa	Speaker	TifaNow we're going to fight Sephiroth.I wonder what the inside of that cave looks like? You think Sephiroth is just sitting there waiting for Meteor?	Sephiroth	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaI can't believe Sephiroth is Hojo's son...	Sephiroth	Referent

 Tifa	Speaker	TifaI wonder what Aerith felt... when she was on that altar...?	Aerith	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaReally? I wonder? I don't think that's it at all.I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she planned on coming back all along.She always used to talk about the 'Next time'.She talked about the future more than any of us...Although she never talked about it to us she must've had a rough life...I think Aerith looked forward to tomorrow and the future more than anyone......she must've had many many dreams......	Aerith	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaThe time has come to settle things with Sephiroth, huh?	Sephiroth	Referent
 Tifa	Speaker	TifaI, too, have lost many things because of Sephiroth.Let's go!	Sephiroth	Referent

 Bugenhagen	Speaker	BugenhagenHo Ho Hoooo. Nanaki's tribe has incredible longevity.So you see his 48 years would only be equivalent to say that of a 15 or 16 year old in human reckoning.	Nanaki	Referent
 Bugenhagen	Speaker	BugenhagenHo Ho Hoooo. No Nanaki. You can't stand on your own yet.To do that now would destroy you in the long run.Reaching up into the heavens, threatening to snatch the very stars from the great city of Midgar. You've seen it, haven't you?Well, that's a bad example. Looking up too much makes you lose perspective.When it's time for this planet to die, you'll understand that you know absolutely nothing.

 Bugenhagen	Speaker	BugenhagenListen, Nanaki.Cloud says they are trying to save the planet.Honestly, I don't think it can be done.For even if they stop every reactor on the planet, it's only going to postpone the inevitable.Even if they stop Sephiroth, everything will perish.But, Nanaki. I've been thinking lately.I've been thinking if there was anything WE could do,as a part of the planet, something to help a planet already in misery...No matter what happens, isn't it important to try?Am I just wishing against fate?I am too old to do anything about it...This year, I'll be 130.

An island floating in the Southern Sea...What did you say? I haven't left here in years... No good. I can't remember.In the Southern Seas I think there was an island where Lifestream is.But even if you find Cloud there...Life's dream is a mass of spiritual energy,and one person alone probably couldn't stand against such an incredible spiritual current...	Cloud	Referent
 Bugenhagen	Speaker	BugenhagenI don't know... But, it probably has something to do with our riddle.The riddle... then it must have something to do with Aerith.	Aerith	Referent

 Bugenhagen	Speaker	Bugenhagen...listen, Nanaki. I think you may already know.If you have any mission in life, it is not to defend this valley.Look at the withering mountain grass. Listen to the warble of the new born chocobo's.Look always to the eternal flow of time which is far greater than the span of a human life.It will teach you more, than staying here in the valley...What you will see will eventually become a part of life's dream.For my children......

But to tell the truth, I feel so behind on everything... so out of it.Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean.Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some money....but, to do that, I guess I have to find a job first. That's right. I still haven't found a job yet.I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with Shinra, Inc.I wonder if it's too late to go back.

 Hojo	Speaker	HojoNo, I remember you all now......Yes, yes. I remember now.It's been a long time, Cloud.	Cloud	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	HojoHeh heh heh...... All right. You sure are loud.Long time no see, Cloud.	Cloud	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	HojoHmm, Aerith? What a nice name...... Ha, ha, ha.	Aerith	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	HojoHa, ha, ha...... Just you wait, Sephiroth.I'll give you all the Mako you want.	Sephiroth	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	HojoShow me...... Sephiroth.It should be near...Ha, ha, ha...... Go beyond the powers of science...Before your presence, science is powerless...I hate it, but I'll concede to it.Just... let me see it.Ha, ha, ha......	Sephiroth	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	HojoEvery time I see you, I...It pains me that I had so little scientific sense...I evaluated you as a failed project.But, you are the only one that succeeded as a Sephiroth-clone.Heh, heh, heh...... I'm even beginning to hate myself.	Sephiroth	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	HojoHa, ha, ha... Although he doesn't know.Ha, ha, ha... HA, HA, HA...!!What will Sephiroth think when he finds out I'm his father?Always looking down on me like that.HA, HA, HA...!!	Sephiroth	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	HojoHa, ha, ha...I offered the woman with my child to Professor Gast's Jenova Project.When Sephiroth was still in the womb, we took the cells of Jenova...HA, HA, HA!!	Sephiroth	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	HojoHeh heh heh......That land is no one's.It's where the Reunion will take place...... They will all gather here......I wonder if we'll see...... Sephiroth?	Sephiroth	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	Hojo...He's a Sephiroth-clone I created after the real Sephiroth died five years ago.Jenova cells and Mako, with my knowledge and skills, have been combined with science and nature to bring him to life....I'm not wild about the failure part, but the Jenova Reunion Theory has now been proven.You see, even if Jenova's body is dismembered, it will eventually become one again. That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion.I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have passed, and now the Clones have begun to return.I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where Jenova is stored.But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself began to move away from the Shinra Building.But being a genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it was all Sephiroth's doing.Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the Lifestream; he wants to manipulate the Clones himself.	Sephiroth	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	HojoThe one thing that I did know was that Sephiroth was at their final destination.	Sephiroth	Referent
 Hojo	Speaker	HojoDid you see it!! It's Sephiroth! So he IS here!This is perfect! Both Jenova's Reunion and Sephiroth's will!They won't be diffused into the Lifestream,but gathered here! Mwa, haa, ha,......	Sephiroth	Referent

 Crew Member	Speaker	Crew Member......Well......... Um, what should I talk about?Wanna hear why we rebelled?Working on the Highwind, we spent every day slaving under Heidegger.Whenever he got yelled at by the President, he'd immediately take it out on the crew.We put up with this all the time. Even when he beat us.I mean, I finally made it on the crew of the famous Highwind, and there's no way I was going to quit over him.Let's see, it must've been a week ago... it was my shift and we were heading towards the North Cave.Everyone, including the President and Scarlet, got on.And with them, I saw Cid, a legendary pilot!And he was looking around the inside of the ship looking really, y'know, nostalgic......He even talked to us.I couldn't believe it! I was so impressed! He was every bit as warmhearted as we'd always heard.Cid said that if he had the Highwind, things would be a lot easier.And now here we are off to save the planet. It's true. He really overwhelmed me.And that's why we decided to help.After the North Cave, we went to Junon, and I started screaming 'Fire! Fire!'In the middle of all the commotion, we stole this ship from the Shinra.That's how it happened. .......Just a minor mutiny against our leaders.But Barret and you were captured by Heidegger......We waited seven days for a chance to rescue you guys, before we finally could.So thanks to our successful mission, we were able to see you again.I hope I didn't bore you too much with that long story.
