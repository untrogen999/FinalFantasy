<stage>Cloud and the others pass through North Corel on their way to Gold Saucer.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>A buncha guys called Turks came here sayin' they'd pay 10000 gil for some rock called a 'Keystone'.<boxstart/>When I asked how much they'd pay for a regular rock just layin' around here, they slapped me upside my damn head!! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Man 2">Man 2</speaker><boxstart/>I'll never understand the rich. I heard some guy named Dio at the Gold Saucer is collectin' rocks! </sp>
<stage>They take the Ropeway up to Gold Saucer.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Fortune Telling Machine">Fortune Telling Machine</speaker> (at Wonder Square)<boxstart/>What you are looking for is near. </sp>
<stage>Cloud and the others make their way to Battle Square, which has by now reopened.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>I heard that this is the curator's favorite attraction. He likes it so much that he even has his collection displayed in the arena. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Are you here for the battle, too? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- That's the idea<boxstart/>- Not interested </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>That's the idea </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>I like fighters. But hate those who're all talk. </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Not interested </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Is that so. </sp>

<stage>Cloud continues on up the steps.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Black-haired Man">Black-haired Man</speaker><boxstart/>Crap! I still don't have enough points.<boxstart/>Mmm? You're new here, aren't you? Then, you want an explanation of the Battle Arena? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeah<boxstart/>- Not interested </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Black-haired Man">Black-haired Man</speaker><boxstart/>You fight here and collect battle points. You can then exchange those points for prizes.<boxstart/>The Battle Game... even though it's a game you still use all your physical abilities. To participate, go to the front and pay yer GP's.<boxstart/>You can fight in up to eight battles. The more you win, the more battle points you get.<boxstart/>But, if you lose, you lose all your points. So it's up to you whether or not to fight after each win.<boxstart/>They also make it harder by givin' out handicaps.<boxstart/>They decide what handicaps there'll be, and you won't know what you're up against until the battle.<boxstart/>Oh yeah, once you leave the Battle area, all your battle points will become useless. So watch it.<boxstart/>Oh, and one other thing. The maximum points you could get is 65000, no more. So if you get that many you should exchange them for something. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Large Man">Large Man</speaker><boxstart/>Maybe I could've made it a little further. It's so hard to know when to stop...<boxstart/>Man, I knew I should've stopped. But it's so hard to stop... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Man Practicing Kicks">Man Practicing Kicks</speaker><boxstart/>I'm not going to lose this time!<boxstart/>All right, it should be my turn comin' up here soon. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Registration Lady">Registration Lady</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, have you heard? Something awful happened!<boxstart/>Two staff members and some Shinra soldiers were shot.<boxstart/>The soldiers died instantly, but the staff survived. </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Staff Person">Staff Person</speaker><boxstart/>Whenever you come to the Gold Saucer, I recommend you visit the owner's museum at least once. </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh. Sorry, but it's not for rent.<boxstart/>Hmm.<boxstart/>Since you've been good to me in the past, I CAN let you have it on one condition. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>One condition? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh. Entertain me! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- What'd you want me to do?<boxstart/>- Not in the mood </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Hoo boy!<boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh. It's not something that's really difficult.<boxstart/>This is the Battle Arena. Show me your fighting skills. Just you, my boy. I'm expecting a good fight! </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Not in the mood </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>I see... Then let's pretend that this never happened. </sp>

<stage>When Cloud takes him up on the deal, he enters the Battle Arena.</stage>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If he completes all 8 battles...</sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Heh, heh, heh! Well done, young man! All right, as I promised,<boxstart/>you can take it. Oh, and I'll give you this too. </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="unspecified"/><boxstart/>Received Key Item "Keystone"! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Dio">Dio</speaker><boxstart/>Well then, we shall meet again! Heh, heh, heh. </sp>
<stage>When trying to leave Gold Saucer with the keystone, Cloud is intercepted by a staff member.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Staff">Staff</speaker><boxstart/>Excuse me, sir.<boxstart/>I'm sorry. The Tram is out of order right now. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...so? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Staff">Staff</speaker><boxstart/>I'm really sorry!<boxstart/>I'm afraid you won't be able to leave until it's fully repaired. </sp>
<stage>If Cait Sith is not in the party, he bounces up to join Cloud now.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>What's wrong? </sp>
<stage>Cloud explains.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Too bad. It happens, though.<boxstart/>I know! Let's stay at the hotel! They know me here. I'll go talk to them. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Staff">Staff</speaker><boxstart/>I will let you know once the repairs are completed. </sp>
<stage>At the hotel, the entire team gathers in the lobby.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>We don't usually get the chance to be together like this, huh?<boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>, how 'bout it? Can you tell us what's happened so far?<boxstart/>I don't really know what's goin' on because I wasn't here in the beginning. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah! I'm all for it! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Good idea. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>I been here since the beginnin', an' I still don't know what the hell's goin' on either.<boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>, the hell's goin' on? C'mon, tell us! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- I'm tired...<boxstart/>- All right, I'll give it a shot... </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>I'm tired... </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>All we have to do now is sleep! You're still young! What're you complaining about? </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>All right, I'll give it a shot... </sp>
  <stage>Nothing special happens.</stage>

<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Phew...<boxstart/>We are going after Sephiroth.<boxstart/><referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent> must be in search of the Promised Land. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>The Promised Land? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>A land full of Mako energy. ...or at least that's what the Shinra believe.<boxstart/>I don't know if it actually exists. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>The Cetras return to the Promised Land. A land that promises boundless happiness. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Cetra? That some kinda disease? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>That's what the Ancients call themselves.<boxstart/>Hey, didn't you listen to the elders at Cosmo Canyon? </sp>
<stage>Barret scratches his head.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...You don't 'know' where the Promised Land of the Ancients is.<boxstart/>You search and travel, until you feel it. Like you just know, '...this is the Promised Land.' </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/><referent name="Aerith">Aerith</referent>... can you feel it too? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I think so. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>So <referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent> is traveling the world because he's searching for the Promised Land? Is that it? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>That, and one other thing he's searching for. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>The Black Materia... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>I heard from Dio that a man in a Black Cape was lookin' for the Black Materia. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I don't even know what the Black Cape is...<boxstart/>How many men with Black Capes and number tattoos are there? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>...you know, of course... My tattoo is number 13. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>How did you get that tattoo? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>...Hojo put it on me. Everything else is just war scars, but the number was done by Hojo. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>So there are at least 13!? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...You know......<boxstart/>I think Hojo did something to those men in the Black Capes.<boxstart/>But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though...<boxstart/>That's why I think we should just go after <referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent> himself. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, me too! It's all just too damn confusin'. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>And...<boxstart/>I'm sorry, forget it!<boxstart/>I think I'm tired. I'm going to bed now. </sp>
<stage>She runs upstairs.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>What was that, all of a sudden!? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What!? That's it? I'm goin' to bed! </sp>
<stage>She runs off after Aerith.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Is that all? How 'bout the Black Materia? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You wouldn't understand even if I told you. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Now all we gotta do is take action! We're startin' tomorrow!! </sp>
<stage>He runs upstairs.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>...<boxstart/>I'm number 13. Am I going to go mad too? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I don't know what Hojo did to you, but you've been all right so far, right? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>But... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Be strong. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>But, I... </sp>
