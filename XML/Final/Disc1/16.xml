	<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>What happened? </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Sh...!<boxstart/>Shinra soldiers... Even here... </sp>

<stage>The soldiers disperse to different areas of the Gold Saucer, and after a moment Cloud heads up the stairs.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Lady at Entrance">Lady at Entrance</speaker><boxstart/>Welcome to Chocobo Racing. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Man Betting">Man Betting</speaker><boxstart/>I... I lost... </sp>
<stage>Or, sometimes:</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>Yeahh! This is why I can't seem to quit. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>You can only buy up to 3 tickets. Think before you buy. For example, you could select half of the Chocobos and buy 3 boxes. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Boxes?<boxstart/>- Not interested </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>A box is buying 3 combinations of 2 chocobos.<boxstart/>For example, if you select Chocobo 1, 3, and 5, you can purchase combinations, such as 1-3, 1-5, 3-5.<boxstart/>You can also play the limited wheel by selecting a Chocobo. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Limited wheel?<boxstart/>- Not interested </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Playing a 'Limited wheel' means you select a Chocobo and use it in all of your combinations.<boxstart/>For example, if you have Chocobo 1, then you buy 1-2, 1-3, 1-4.<boxstart/>No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. It all comes down to insight and luck. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Security">Security</speaker> (near Jockey Lounge)<boxstart/>I'm sorry, but this is for authorized personnel only. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Blond Man">Blond Man</speaker><boxstart/>We usually buy tickets for the B rank and C rank races, right? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Rank?<boxstart/>- Not interested </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Blond Man">Blond Man</speaker><boxstart/>In other words, 'rank' means the Chocobo's 'strength'. A is highest and C's the lowest.<boxstart/>When you become a Free Chocobo jockey, you'll be able to buy A rank tickets.<boxstart/>Of course, the higher the rank, the better your item ticket. Hey, maybe I'll become a Chocobo jockey!? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- How DO you become one?<boxstart/>- Not interested </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Blond Man">Blond Man</speaker><boxstart/>You can become one if you own a Chocobo... and have some connections. But Chocobo's are pretty hard to catch and I don't have any connections. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, what's that Chocobo on the odds sheet? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Redhead">Redhead</speaker><boxstart/>That's how you can find out a Chocobo's condition and strengths. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, If you can tell which ones are the strongest, then it's easy... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Redhead">Redhead</speaker><boxstart/>Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the Chocobo's strength,<boxstart/>but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's personality.<boxstart/>If these are bad, they may use too much stamina, and affect other things. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Lady at the Ticket Desk">Lady at the Ticket Desk</speaker><boxstart/>Welcome. Would you like to buy some Chocobo tickets? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeah<boxstart/>- Ask how to buy<boxstart/>- Explain it to me<boxstart/>- Not interested </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Yeahhh!<boxstart/>- No way! </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Lady at the Ticket Desk">Lady at the Ticket Desk</speaker><boxstart/>Which rank would you like to select? </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- C (1BET 1 0 0 gil)<boxstart/>- B (1BET 2 0 0 gil)<boxstart/>- Quit </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Ask how to buy </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Lady at the Ticket Desk">Lady at the Ticket Desk</speaker><boxstart/>You are allowed a maximum of 3 bets on your Chocobo ticket. </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Explain it to me </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Lady at the Ticket Desk">Lady at the Ticket Desk</speaker><boxstart/>This Chocobo Race has Virtual devices on the course.<boxstart/>They show natural scenery during the race that really doesn't exist.<boxstart/>You pick which Chocobo will finish first and second here,<boxstart/>And then buy the appropriate tickets.<boxstart/>And if the ticket you purchased is a winner, you'll receive a ticket for an item that will be listed on the panel.<boxstart/>You can exchange your tickets for items or GP at the Exchange counter to the right of the entrance. </sp>

<stage>Cloud plays Mog House.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>This is Mog's house. It's in Mog Forest on Mt. Mog.<boxstart/>The beginning of another day in the life of a Mog.<boxstart/>This year, Mog is pipapopupo years old. ...that's 28 in human years. He's at that age when he should be looking for a mate.<boxstart/>But before Mog can become an adult, he first needs to learn how to fly.<boxstart/>Even though Mog trains hard everyday... He still can't seem to get off the ground... </sp>
<stage>Mog tries to fly and falls on his face.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Looks like he's still got a long way to go...<boxstart/>Here's where you come in. Help Mog learn how to fly by pushing O button and feeding him his favorite Kupo nut.<boxstart/>But don't overfeed him. He won't be able to fly if he's too fat. </sp>
<stage>Cloud feeds Mog Kupo nuts, and he hops up again.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it. </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If <referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent> fed him the wrong number of nuts...</sp>
  <stage>He falls flat on his face again.</stage>
  <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Poor Mog. It looks like he'll have to wait some time for a mate.<boxstart/>Poor Mog, seems like he'll be alone for a while. </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If <referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent> fed him the right number of nuts...</sp>
  <stage>Mog takes off and makes a few circuits around the screen.</stage>
  <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>He did it! He's flying! Now, he's finally become a full-fledged Mog. </sp>
  <stage>Mog lands and returns to his house, taking a bow before going inside.</stage>
  <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Tired but relaxed, our little Mog turns out the lights early and goes to bed. Good night, and sweet dreams...... </sp>
  <stage>A pink moogle appears.</stage>
  <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Oh?... What's this? Here comes a female Mog! </sp>
  <stage>She approaches Mog's house and knocks. Mog comes out and chirps.</stage>
  <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Seems he likes her too...<boxstart/>Now, will Mog be able to fly gracefully in front of her? Help him out with a few kupo nuts. </sp>
  <stage>Cloud feeds Mog Kupo nuts, and he hops up again.</stage>
  <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it. </sp>
  
    <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If <referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent> fed Mog the wrong number of nuts...</sp>
    <stage>He falls on his face again.</stage>
    <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Unfortunately, he didn't make it. Poor Mog'll have to wait some time for a bride.<boxstart/>Poor Mog, seems like he'll be alone for a while. </sp>
  
  
    <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If <referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent> fed him the right number of nuts...</sp>
    <stage>Mog takes off and makes a few circuits around the screen.</stage>
    <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>He's flying!! Mog was able to do it!<boxstart/>She must have fallen for his graceful flying form. </sp>
    <stage>The screen goes dark.</stage>
    Sometime later...
    <stage>Mog steps out of his house.</stage>
    <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Looks like things are going good with his new Mog-friend. Time for a quiet date in the forest.<boxstart/>Her name is Mag. She is a good-natured Mog. </sp>
    <stage>Mog and Mag leave the house and walk off screen.</stage>
    <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Best of luck to the both of you, Mog and Mag. May you have lots and lots of healthy Mogs! </sp>
    <stage>No fewer than 12 baby moogles exit the house. The last one trips and falls on his face. One of the others comes back for him and they run off.</stage>
    <sp> <speaker name="Narration">Narration</speaker><boxstart/>Uh...no worries there, I guess... </sp>
    ~FIN~
    <stage>The game ends.</stage>
    <sp> <speaker name="Guy Near Mog Game">Guy Near Mog Game</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... I'm impressed... Thanks for showing me it.<boxstart/>Here, take this. </sp>

<stage>Returning to Battle Square, Cloud and the others arrive to find a Shinra soldier standing in front of the stairs.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>!! </sp>
<stage>The soldier collapses, and Cloud goes over to investigate.</stage>
