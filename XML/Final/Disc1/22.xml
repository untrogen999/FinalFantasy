<stage>They go north and arrive in Wutai, where they immediately spot Yuffie.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Hey!! </sp>
<stage>She runs off.</stage>
<stage>Outside Yuffie's house..</stage>

<sp> <speaker name="Man">Man</speaker><boxstart/>Hey. Did you hear? There used to be a Water God here in Wutai.<boxstart/>They say the Water God was a huge snake!<boxstart/>Now we live in a world filled with Mako.

<stage>Cloud walks up to the Turks - Reno, Rude, and Elena - who are drinking at a table.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Yy, you!? How did you get here...? </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>...even the booze tastes bad now. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>...sorry... </sp>
<stage>She sits back down, and Cloud relaxes.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Elena">Elena</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight!<boxstart/>The next time we meet I won't be so nice. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Drink, <referent name="Rude">Rude</referent>! How long have we been a team...?<boxstart/>There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm glad I did it.<boxstart/>I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you. </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Little Kid">Little Kid</speaker><boxstart/>Alright, alright, alright! I know!<boxstart/>On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!<boxstart/>I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!<boxstart/>A girl with materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing Da-chao for some time now.<boxstart/>You know I've noticed that there's  pounding noise from time to time in this store. </sp>

<stage>In the Item Shop...</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Item Shopkeeper">Item Shopkeeper</speaker><boxstart/>We got a lot of different stuff here. Take what you want. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>I'm sorry. The sign outside says "Materia", but there's almost no materia left anywhere in Wutai.<boxstart/>Listen, this is just a backwoods town. We don't have much to do with Shinra, and besides...<boxstart/>If we had a lot of materia, Wutai would be a much more exciting town, but we don't... </sp>
<stage>Cloud opens the nearby treasure chest.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="unspecified"/><boxstart/>Received "MP Absorb" Materia! </sp>
<stage>Yuffie jumps down from above.</stage>

I guess our beliefs were based on nothing more than legends. </sp>
<stage>Inside the pagoda...</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>... </sp>
<stage>If Cloud tries to run upstairs...</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Freeze!<boxstart/>You aren't from Wutai, are you? </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! I hate people who lie about their identities! Leave this tower at once! </sp>

<stage>Inside Godo's house, they find Godo lying on a futon.</stage>

<stage>He sits up.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>Listen, I said I didn't know her! There isn't anyone named <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent> here in Wutai! </sp>
<stage>He gets to his feet and turns to face Cloud.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>...never seen you around here before...<boxstart/>Lately I've been seeing a lot of Shinra soldiers around here... You wouldn't have anything to do with that would you?<boxstart/>I don't care about who you are.<boxstart/>But if you're in trouble with the Shinra, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.<boxstart/>I don't want the Shinra hanging around here looking over my shoulder. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What's with you, you coward! </sp>
<stage>She jumps down from the ceiling to stand in his doorway.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/><referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>......! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>You scared of the Shinra?<boxstart/>Then why don't you fall into line and obey them, just like all of the other towns! </sp>
<stage>She runs into the room.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>Those guys are the ones who are really fighting the Shinra! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Shut up! What would you know about this? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>You get beaten once, and then that's it?<boxstart/>What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>No kid like you's going to talk to me like that!<boxstart/>You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>That's my style! And it's my own business, not yours! Don't you try and dictate what I should do! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Style...? Dictate...?<boxstart/>Throwin' around all those fancy words... You're a miserable daughter! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Hmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!! </sp>
<stage>She runs out and into the shrine down the hall. Godo starts to chase after her, but gives up and returns to his room.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>......take your things and get out of here now.<boxstart/>To protect Wutai, we cannot afford to stand up to Shinra. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Man on the Path to Godo's House">Man on the Path to Godo's House</speaker><boxstart/>She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.<boxstart/>Like father like daughter...<boxstart/><referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>'s like that, you know. Sometimes she'll just bust into people's houses.<boxstart/>Then she hides in the shadows... Just like a little kid. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Woman Walking near River">Woman Walking near River</speaker><boxstart/>Life is just like the flowing of a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it.<boxstart/>Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see.<boxstart/><referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>? I saw her a while ago. She must be in one of the houses around here. </sp>
<stage>At the old man's house...</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Boy">Boy</speaker><boxstart/>Oh no! More weirdos<boxstart/>No, these aren't like the one from a while ago, but these ones look weird too! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Old Man">Old Man</speaker><boxstart/>Well, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see... what was your name? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Boy">Boy</speaker><boxstart/>No, Gramps! This isn't anyone you know! This is just some stranger who barged into our house!<boxstart/>What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl came in here a minute ago and I... </sp>
<stage>Cloud pushes aside a screen to reveal Yuffie hiding behind it.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>...... </sp>
<stage>She dashes out of the house.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Old Man">Old Man</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, how exciting. You a friend of my grandson's? </sp>

<stage>If Cloud tries to leave Wutai...</stage>

	<sp> <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Wait, that damn <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>'s still gotta be somewhere in this cheap town! Or you all jes' gonna go on? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I don't think she came out from here... Is that ok? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Knowing <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>, she's still hidden somewhere in town. You sure? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>I know she hasn't left town! You still want to leave? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>She couldn't have left town... I think she is must still be here... Or do you want to go on? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>You lettin' that damn kid off the hook? I know she's gotta be in this town somewhere! </sp>

<stage>Outside the Turtle's Paradise, there is a barrel that's jiggling. Cloud and the others position themselves near the escape routes and then open it. Yuffie jumps out and tries to get away, but finds herself surrounded.</stage>

	<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You can't get away, <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Give it up, <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>! </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>You lost, <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>. </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>O... ok, I know... I was wrong......<boxstart/>You win. I'll give you back your materia... </sp>
<stage>She leads them to her house, just as two soldiers run into Turtle's Paradise.</stage>

<sp> <speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>So our reports were right! He IS here on vacation!<boxstart/>We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>...what a drag. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Wh, what was that...? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Right now we're off duty and can't run off to save your butts. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>We know you're off duty, but... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>If you knew that, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' me sober. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shinra Soldier">Shinra Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>But you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too! </sp>
<stage>There is a pause. Reno says nothing.</stage>

<stage>Cloud goes to the bell near Godo's house to find the gate open. When he rings the bell, a hidden door opens. Going inside, he finds Yuffie being abducted by a man in black.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Let go! I SAID let GO!<boxstart/>Hey! Who do you think I...... OW! What're you doin'...? Jerk! </sp>

<stage>Corneo and his lackeys run off, and Cloud follows them into the shrine. Three Shinra soldiers cut Corneo off.</stage>

<stage>Corneo runs to the side, and the soldiers attack Cloud and the others instead. Back outside Godo's house, they find Reno and Rude.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... that Corneo is good at escaping... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>......<referent name="Elena">Elena</referent>. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Let's go, <referent name="Rude">Rude</referent>. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can do. </sp>
<stage>Rude nods and runs off.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>......Sounded pretty good. </sp>
<stage>He turns to Cloud.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>If <referent name="Elena">Elena</referent> is in his hands, that's going to make things a little difficult.<boxstart/>And uh... </sp>

	<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>......Ok. Corneo took Yuffie from us.<boxstart/>And without <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>, there's no way we'll get our materia back. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>......all right. Corneo stole <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent> from us, as well.<boxstart/>And without her, there's no way we'll get our materia back. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>......that's just beautiful! And now that *#$^@'s walked off with <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>, too!<boxstart/>And without that brat, we can't get our hands on our materia! </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Don't misunderstand.<boxstart/>We have no intention of joining you. But for now, we'll agree not to bother each other. That's all. </sp>

	<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>That's fine. We have absolutely no intention of cooperating with the Turks either.<boxstart/>Now, uh, just what direction did Corneo run off to? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>The same goes for us. We don't want to be friendly with the Turks.<boxstart/>Now which direction did Corneo run off in? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Of course! There ain't no way we'd wanna join up with the Turks anyway!<boxstart/>Anyhow, which direction did that %^$*&amp; run off in? </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the place that stands out the most. </sp>
<stage>Reno runs off.</stage>

<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Hey---who cares about that!? Get----me-----down----! </sp>
<stage>Back at Yuffie's house. She darts around putting the materia back in its slots.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Phew, perfect. Now the materia is back in its rightful place. </sp>

<stage>She shakes her fist and turns away.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>That Corneo guy's a real pain. </sp>
<stage>Behind her back, Cloud and the others exchange looks.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy. </sp>
<stage>Cloud and the others walk out.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, by the way, some of those guys from the Turks are good, huh?<boxstart/>At least, after all that, we got the materia back.<boxstart/>Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey... </sp>
<stage>She turns around to notice they've gone.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>......Hey!! W...... Wait!<boxstart/>Oh, all right. Here, I'll give this to you guys. </sp>
<stage>She runs into her room to grab something and comes back out.</stage>

<sp> <boxstart/>No matter what anyone says, I'm going with you!<boxstart/>...next time...... </sp>

Alright, alright, alright! I don't know! </sp>
<stage>Cloud and the others enter the pagoda.</stage>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she loses...</sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>It's just my opinion, but you need more training! Gorky is disappointed! </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>No good! You have to do Gorky! Are you mocking this Pagoda? </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP! </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she wins...</sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Here I am, Miss <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>! </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Of course! </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm, I thought you were just a wild girl, but you handled that pretty well!<boxstart/>Well, we'll see how you do on next one... </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Who's next? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Are you blind? I'm right here! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>What? I gotta fight a punk? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Heh! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Wh, what did you say!? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>See what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so immature!<boxstart/>Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Now watch...! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>'bout the only thing you do really good is breathe! Sure you're brave enough to fight! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>- Stop yappin'!<boxstart/>- I'll forgive you </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Stop yappin'! </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Hm, so someone finally got past Gorky. </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>I'll forgive you </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>So when it comes down to it, you're just all talk. Brat! </sp>

<stage>A woman comes down from upstairs.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>So, I guess it's time for Chekhov to stand in... </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>URRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit! </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Of course! </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Ho, ho, ho... It's been a while since I felt pain... </sp>

<stage>Chekhov goes upstairs, and Yuffie follows. A man comes down from the fourth floor.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>So even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had to fight, Chekhov. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes. Staniv, you watch over there. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>That ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength of youth! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Keep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to get burned. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>- I got insurance<boxstart/>- Let's get this over with, old bag </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>I got insurance </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Ho, ho, ho. We'll see if you still talk like that after you taste some of my Sacred Magic...<boxstart/>Magic Change! </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Let's get this over with, old bag </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Ho, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of diapers!? </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>First, Chekhov will keep you company... </sp>
<stage>If Yuffie tries to go to the next floor prematurely...</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>How dare they mock us like that, thinking they could sneak past us. </sp>
<stage>Yuffie fights Chekhov.</stage>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she loses...</sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Ho, ho, ho! What does a immature young child know...? </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>So this IS the average person's limit... </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP! </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she wins...</sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>I can't believe you beat me... </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Of course! </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>This should be interesting...! It's been a long time since I've had a chance to use my powers to their fullest... </sp>

<stage>Staniv goes upstairs, and Yuffie follows.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>The rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your opponent... Although it's a five-storied pagoda, the fourth floor is the highest...<boxstart/>In other words, no one has ever defeated me--Master of Weaponry!<boxstart/>You still want to try...? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>- Just come on!!<boxstart/>- I'll pass! </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Just come on!! </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>I like you! Now watch...<boxstart/>Weapon Change! </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>I'll pass! </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>You don't seem like the kind of person who can make it to the fourth floor without a problem... </sp>

<stage>If Yuffie tries to go to the next floor prematurely...</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>HAAAAH! </sp>
<stage>The door closes.<boxstart/><boxstart/><referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent> fights Staniv.</stage>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she loses...</sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>How unfortunate! It was over before I could even put all of my strength into it... </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP! </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If she wins...</sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>Wh, what...!? </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Of course! </sp>

<stage>The others start coming up from the lower floors.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Splendid! Your level and skills have improved... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, ho! You might not be as much of a child as we thought you were! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Of course. If WE lost to her... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>You have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to face HIM......! </sp>
<stage>He goes upstairs, and the others follow. Yuffie finds the four of them assembled on the fifth floor, along with Godo.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>...... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>Sh......! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>...... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>D, ...Dad!? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>I'm glad you made it this far, <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Why, why are you...... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>I'll answer you by having you try your skills against me!<boxstart/>Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you don't... then I'll have to kill you! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>H... hey! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>What are you doing! OMNI-Change! ......!! </sp>
<stage>Yuffie fights Godo.<boxstart/><boxstart/>If she loses...</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Dammit...... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Ohhh! And what was that!? Come back when you get more training! </sp>
<stage>When Yuffie tries again...</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'll show you this time, you old Fart-meister! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm? A slight improvement.<boxstart/>Come at me with all you have! OMNI-Change! ......!! </sp>
<stage>After winning the battle, both lie sprawled on the floor panting.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>...heave...... heave... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>...huff...... puff...... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>O... old coot... n...... ot... bad... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>You've...... also...... improved... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Hah... Ha, ha...... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>...Heh, heh...... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Ha ha haaaaaa......! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Waha haaaaa......! </sp>
<stage>They eventually get up off the floor and compose themselves.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>It's time I gave this to you, <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>...<boxstart/>This is Leviathan Materia. Take it. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="unspecified"/><boxstart/>Received "Leviathan" Materia! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>But, Lord Godo. The Leviathan Materia should only be given to the person who conquers and takes over this Pagoda. That is our custom... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>CUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM... I'm so sick of hearing that!<boxstart/>It's so stupid! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Silence, Miss <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Then what 'bout the rest of you? You have all that power...<boxstart/>Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/><referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>...! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>You too, dad...! Just because you lost the war!<boxstart/>And turning Wutai into a place like this! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>...What do you want to say? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>You turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to tourists...<boxstart/>How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>She IS a kid. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Wh, what did you say...!? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/><referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>!!<boxstart/>Forgive me... It's all my fault... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>What are you saying, Lord Godo! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Losing the war... turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Lord Godo! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Silence!!<boxstart/><referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>......<boxstart/>I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war.<boxstart/>But, after I lost the war, I began to think...<boxstart/>Is strength, only for defeating the enemy?<boxstart/>...or just something to show-off to others...?<boxstart/>Might begets might.<boxstart/>That's the same way as the Shinra... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>...... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>I knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai.<boxstart/>But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai...<boxstart/>And now, I realize both are necessary...<boxstart/>Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless...! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>Lord Godo... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>You there, please take <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent> with you!<boxstart/>I perceive that you all have both determination and strength! </sp>

	<sp> <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Jes' don't do nothin' funny to our Materia...! </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>All right. We'll take your daughter with us. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>...after that, how can we refuse? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>As long as she doesn't get in our way...! </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>If you put it that way, we can't refuse... </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... You may come if you want to... </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Well, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the rest to ol' <referent name="Cid">Cid</referent>! </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>All right, I don't mind. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Go, <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>!<boxstart/>For the sake of strengthening Wutai! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Dad... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>I'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return!<boxstart/>Go! And come back alive! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>......<boxstart/>Of course! </sp>
<stage>Everyone else files out, and Yuffie starts to follow them.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/><referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>, wait a minute.<boxstart/>The Materia they all have...<boxstart/>After their battle is over, you think they'll still want it? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Dad...! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Go! Survive till the end! And return!<boxstart/>With the Materia! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Heh, heh... you bet! </sp>
<stage>She runs off.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Godo">Godo</speaker><boxstart/>Go! Survive to the end! And return to us!<boxstart/>Mat-...<boxstart/>Take care of the Materia!! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Staniv">Staniv</speaker><boxstart/>Miss <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>. Your feelings for Wutai are the same as Lord Godo's. Always remember that... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Chekhov">Chekhov</speaker><boxstart/>Fight so that you never bring shame on Wutai. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Shake">Shake</speaker><boxstart/>You say there's some unusual materia where the underground pipe is!?<boxstart/>But, first you gotta get if from a monster and unless you use your head. You won't be able to do it. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Gorky">Gorky</speaker><boxstart/>Miss <referent name="Yuffie">Yuffie</referent>. We pray for your success! </sp>
