<sp> <speaker name="Letter">Letter</speaker><boxstart/>I must get rid of all those that stand in the way of my research. Even that one from the Turks.<boxstart/>I scientifically altered him, and put him to sleep in the basement. If you want to find him, then search the area.<boxstart/>But... this is merely a game I thought of. It is not necessary for you to participate if you don't want to. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>There seems to be another letter.<boxstart/>- Read it<boxstart/>- Ignore it </sp>

<sp> <boxstart/>Who is it!? </sp>
<stage>He sits up.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>...Never seen you before. You must leave. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You were having a nightmare. </sp>

	<sp> <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>I woke ya up. Ya outta be thankin' me. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>You'll dream about bad things if you sleep in a place like THIS. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>How bad was your dream? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>...You don't look good. </sp>

	<sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>The air's pretty heavy here. How can you sleep in a place like this? </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hmph... a nightmare...? My long sleep has given me time to atone. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What are you saying? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out.<boxstart/>This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...you can say that again. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm? What do you know? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Don't say a thing<boxstart/>- Talk about <referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent> </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Don't say a thing </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare...<boxstart/>...What? More? </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- No, good night<boxstart/>- Tell him about <referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent> </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/><referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent>!? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud + Vincent">Cloud + Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>You know <referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent>? </sp>
<stage>Vincent leaps from the coffin and lands on its edge.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>You start first. </sp>
<stage>Cloud gestures as he tells his story.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...That's how it was. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>So <referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent> knows he was created five years ago? And about the Jenova Project?<boxstart/>...He was missing, but has just recently reappeared.<boxstart/>He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land. </sp>
<stage>* <sp> <speaker name="Note">Note</speaker>: Vincent's comment here is likely a translation error and should have been something like "So five years ago, Sephiroth learned that he had been created?"</sp></stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Now it's your turn. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry... I cannot speak. </sp>

	<sp> <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! You lyin' white-faced! </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>That's dirty! </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Hmm... I'm disappointed. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>What... you're serious? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, that's okay. It was probably depressing anyway. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, that's not right--- </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Good! I'm not in the mood to hear long stories. Let's get the hell outta here! </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Hearing your stories, has added upon me yet another sin.<boxstart/>More nightmares shall come to me now, more than I previously had. </sp>
<stage>He gets back into the coffin.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>Now... please leave.<boxstart/>...You're still here. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- Good night<boxstart/>- Who are you? </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Good night </sp>
  <stage>Nothing happens.</stage>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Who are you? </sp>
  At least tell us your name.

<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I was with... the Shinra Manufacturing Department in Administrative Research, otherwise known as--the Turks...<boxstart/><referent name="Vincent">Vincent</referent>. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>The Turks!? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Formerly of the Turks.<boxstart/>I have no affiliation with Shinra now.<boxstart/>...And you? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>, formerly of SOLDIER. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>You were also with Shinra...? Then do you know Lucrecia? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Who? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>......Lucrecia. </sp>
<stage>Cloud shakes his head.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>The woman who gave birth to <referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent>. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...gave birth...?<boxstart/>Wasn't Jenova <referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent>'s mother? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory.<boxstart/>He was born from a beautiful lady.<boxstart/>That lady was Lucrecia.<boxstart/>She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. Beautiful... Lucrecia. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...A human experiment? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>There was no way to cancel the experiment.<boxstart/>I couldn't stop her.<boxstart/>That was my sin.<boxstart/>I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst. </sp>

	<sp> <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>That why you started sleepin' in a box? Gimme a break! </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>So your punishment was to sleep? That's... kinda weird. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>So the punishment was sleep? That's weird. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>So you slept as punishment? Isn't that strange? That thinking... </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>OK. Boring story no. 1. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>You think that's punishing yourself? You're just sleeping. </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>You shouldn't sleep just because of that. Sleep? </sp>

<stage>Vincent lies back down.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Let me sleep... </sp>
<stage>Cloud and the others start back down the hallway.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Wait!<boxstart/>If I go with you will I meet Hojo? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Dunno. But we're after him and <referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent>. So, I guess sooner or later... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>Lucrecia...<boxstart/>All right. I've decided to go with you. </sp>

	<sp> <speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>W, what? </sp>
	<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Sure is a quick change of heart. Huh? </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</speaker><boxstart/>Jenova will be at the Reunion. Jenova will join the Reunion becoming a calamity from the skies. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Jenova, a calamity from the skies? You mean she wasn't an Ancient!? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</speaker><boxstart/>...I see. I don't think you have the right to participate.<boxstart/>I will go North past Mt. Nibel. If you wish to find out... then follow... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...Reunion? Calamity from the skies? </sp>
