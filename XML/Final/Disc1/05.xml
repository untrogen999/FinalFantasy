<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>The gate to Sector 7's in there. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going home? </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>- See her home<boxstart/>- Take her to Sector 7 </sp>

  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>See her home </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Isn't that a little out of the way? </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, I guess so. </sp>


  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>Take her to Sector 7 </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I could do that. But won't I be in your way? </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What do you mean in the way? </sp>
  <sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Nothing! </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Can we take a break? </sp>
<stage>She wanders into the playground and stops by the slide with a cat's face.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>I can't believe it's still here. </sp>
<stage>She runs around and climbs up on top of it.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>, over here! </sp>
<stage>Cloud shrugs and joins her.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>What rank were you? </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>You were... serious? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>No. But I liked him for a while. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I probably knew him. What was his name? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>It doesn't really matter. </sp>
<stage>The gate to Sector 7 opens, and a chocobo-drawn carriage comes out. Tifa is riding in back, wearing a revealing blue dress. Cloud jumps to his feet.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Huh? Hey, back there......<boxstart/><referent name="Tifa">Tifa</referent>!? </sp>
<stage>The carriage pulls past them and into Wall Market.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>That girl in the cart was <referent name="Tifa">Tifa</referent>? Where was she going? She looked kind of odd... </sp>
<stage>Aerith jumps off the slide and runs after the carriage.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Wait!<boxstart/>I'll go on alone! You go on home! </sp>
<stage>He sighs and follows her into Wall Market.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So we've got to find <referent name="Tifa">Tifa</referent> fast. </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Redhead in Suit">Redhead in Suit</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, ladies.<boxstart/>I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't go wandering around... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Now's our chance. Let's find <referent name="Tifa">Tifa</referent>. </sp>
<stage>Of two doors upstairs, one is closed, and the other reads "Office of The Don Corneo Keep Out!" Aerith and Cloud go down a long set of stairs to the basement, where they find Tifa. When Cloud sees her, he turns away. Aerith goes over to talk to her alone.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...<referent name="Tifa">Tifa</referent>?<boxstart/>Nice to meet you. I'm <referent name="Aerith">Aerith</referent>.<boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>'s told me a lot about you. </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Oh...... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>What do you mean, 'Don't worry'... about what?<boxstart/>No, don't misunderstand.<boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent> and I grew up together. Nothing more. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Poor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call him nothing.<boxstart/>Right, <referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>? </sp>
<stage>If Cloud tries to run away upstairs, Aerith comes after him.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Embarrassed? Come on, speak up! </sp>
<stage>Cloud walks up to Tifa, head down.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>???? </sp>
<stage>She peers at him and then jumps several feet in the air.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>!?<boxstart/>Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?<boxstart/>Forget that, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you hurt!? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Hey, give me a chance to answer.<boxstart/>I'm dressed like this...... because there was no other way to get in here.<boxstart/>I'm all right. <referent name="Aerith">Aerith</referent> helped me out. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Oh, <referent name="Aerith">Aerith</referent> did... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/><referent name="Tifa">Tifa</referent>, explain. What are you doing in a place like this? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Yeah, ummm...... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Ahem!! I'll just plug my ears. </sp>
<stage>She walks a short distance away and puts her hands to her ears.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>Please, go on with your private conversation. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>...I'm glad you're OK. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Thanks. What happened? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird man.<boxstart/>So <referent name="Barret">Barret</referent> caught him and squeezed some information out of him. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>That's when the Don's name popped up. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Right, Don Corneo.<boxstart/><referent name="Barret">Barret</referent> told me to leave the lech alone...<boxstart/>But something's been bothering me. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's mouth. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind.<boxstart/>Corneo is looking for a bride.<boxstart/>Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then... ...and, well......<boxstart/>Anyway, I have to be the girl... or I'm out for tonight. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Sorry... but I overheard...<boxstart/>If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>I guess so, but... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>We have two here, right? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>No, <referent name="Aerith">Aerith</referent>! I can't have you get involved. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>Oh? So it's all right for <referent name="Tifa">Tifa</referent> to be in danger? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>No, I don't want <referent name="Tifa">Tifa</referent> in... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Is it all right? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger.<boxstart/>Do you trust me? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Yes. Thanks, Ms. <referent name="Aerith">Aerith</referent>. </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is......<boxstart/>Me...... right? </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>You're right, there was no need... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>...to ask. </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Ha ha... You know, if you look closely, you're not so bad...<boxstart/>I wonder what <referent name="Barret">Barret</referent> would say if he could see you now... </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry. </sp>
<stage>The three of them head back upstairs.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Redhead in Suit">Redhead in Suit</speaker><boxstart/>The Don's waiting in his room... Ha ha ha... </sp>
<stage>They enter Don Corneo's office, where he is seated at his desk, flanked by two lackeys.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Kotch">Kotch</speaker><boxstart/>All right, ladies!<boxstart/>Line up in front of the Don! </sp>

<sp> <speaker name="Don Corneo">Don Corneo</speaker><boxstart/>Hmmm! Good, splendid!<boxstart/>Now, let's see... Which girl should I choose? Hmm---hmm---! </sp>
<stage>He walks to Cloud, who turns his head.</stage>

<stage>He walks to Tifa.</stage>
<sp> <boxstart/>Or this one?<boxstart/>Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!!<boxstart/>My choice for tonight is...... </sp>

<stage>Cloud dispatches Scotch and the other two lackeys. He then hurries back towards the other basement room, where Kotch is chasing Aerith around.</stage>
<sp> <speaker name="Aerith">Aerith</speaker><boxstart/>No---!! </sp>
<sp> <speaker name="Kotch">Kotch</speaker><boxstart/>Ha ha ha... Wait you!! </sp>
