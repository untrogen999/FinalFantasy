I can handle this kinda stuff!<boxstart/>Two levers; one on the right and one on the left...<boxstart/>I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right!?<boxstart/>Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 minutes.<boxstart/>We're gonna fly!! Hold on tight!! </sp>

  <sp><speaker name="Cloud"/><boxstart/>If they fail to catch up to Shinra's train...</sp>
  <sp><speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>DAMN!<boxstart/>Sorry! I couldn't catch up to them! </sp>
