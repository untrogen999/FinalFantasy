<sp><speaker name="Woman">Woman</speaker><boxstart/>They say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world and bringing it to Junon.<boxstart/>Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes.<boxstart/>I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I think they're going to the off-shore Underwater Reactor.<boxstart/>Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia? </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Older Man">Older Man</speaker><boxstart/>I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe underwater.<boxstart/>The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe.<boxstart/>You should be able to get to the reactor through it. </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Priscilla">Priscilla</speaker><boxstart/>Who are you---?<boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>!!<boxstart/>Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the Lifestream? </sp>

I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get in their way either! </sp>
<stage>Cloud runs outside to the airport.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>After they get it, they'll take it to the airport and will transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier 2">Soldier 2</speaker><boxstart/>They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor. </sp>
<stage>Cloud leaves the base and starts down the street, then stops and turns to his companions.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>I may be mistaken, but...... Doesn't it feel like we're missing something? </sp>
<stage>Cloud and the others continue on. On the way to the reactor, they come across a commander drilling his soldiers.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Commander">Commander</speaker><boxstart/>All right!! Let's see how hard you trained!<boxstart/>Attention! Charge--!! </sp>
<stage>The soldiers all charge in the opposite direction.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Commander">Commander</speaker><boxstart/>He... hey--!! That's the Underwater Reactor!! Come back!! </sp>
<stage>Cloud gets on the first elevator with two soldiers and a redhead.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>How 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out? </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier 2">Soldier 2</speaker><boxstart/>All right, you're on!!<boxstart/>But... What if both of us... </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Whoa!! Don't even talk about that! </sp>
<stage>Cloud defeats both of them.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Redhead">Redhead</speaker><boxstart/>...gulp... (Great... there went two perfectly good men!) </sp>
<stage>The elevator reaches the lower floor.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier 3">Soldier 3</speaker><boxstart/>OK! Back to work!! Back to work!! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier 4">Soldier 4</speaker><boxstart/>Yawn... I'm sleepy!! </sp>

<sp><speaker name="Soldiers in Reactor">Soldiers in Reactor</speaker><boxstart/>You, you're <referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>!!<boxstart/>You are NOT getting this Huge Materia!!<boxstart/>So you WERE after the Huge Materia! </sp>
<stage>Cloud and the others reach where the Huge Materia is stored.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>!? The Huge Materia! </sp>
<stage>They watch as a machine arm reaches down and pulls out the materia.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Hey! A Crane Game! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Damn, just missed it! </sp>

<sp><speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>If we take a short cut, we might just make it......! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>There's the submarine dock just ahead of us. </sp>
<stage>They run to the submarine docks. Reno is standing with his back to them, supervising.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Did we make it!? </sp>
<stage>He watches as the Huge Materia is lowered into the red submarine.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>What are you doing? Help load. </sp>
<stage>He turns around.</stage>
<sp><boxstart/><referent name="Cloud">Cloud</referent>!? </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Help? </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>We're gonna help transport the Huge Materia... <referent name="Reno">Reno</referent>! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>I'm SURE! You want me to do manual labor? </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>You know I don't work for cheap! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>I refuse... </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Looks like we barely made it. </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Either give it to us or else.<boxstart/>...which is it gonna be? </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>Unfortunately, I don't have time to deal with you.<boxstart/>My priority is the Huge Materia! </sp>
<stage>He runs off, leaving Cloud and the others to fight a robot. After the battle, they find the red sub has already left.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Damn! The submarine! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>!? The Huge Materia! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Damn! So they was just buyin' time!? </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>We have to go after it! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>But it's already in the water! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>It left the dock! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>There is one way... </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Hold on to your horses! Let's get it from them!! </sp>
<stage>They run for the other submarine, and the soldiers on board turn frantic.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Soldiers">Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>Y, you...!<boxstart/>You're not taking over this ship! </sp>
<stage>They defeat the soldiers and get on board.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Soldiers">Soldiers</speaker><boxstart/>You want the Sub? Just try an' take it!<boxstart/>Um... sir! Maybe we shouldn't piss them off... </sp>
<stage>They fight off these soldiers, too.</stage>

  <stage>The soldiers move aside to let Cloud and the others into the control room.</stage>

<stage>Cloud crouches down, wringing his hands. Yuffie doesn't look any better off.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Someone... please. I'm sorry I can't take it anymore.<boxstart/>The lack of space, the shaking, the roar of the engine... </sp>

<stage>Cloud and the others get on with the mission and shoot down the red leader sub.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Phew--! We did it!!<boxstart/>The Huge Materia should be at the bottom of the sea by now. Let's continue the search... </sp>

<sp><speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Oh my gawd...! They mean us. </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>We need to respond! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Vincent">Vincent</speaker><boxstart/>We've no choice but to respond. </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>All right, I'll do it.<boxstart/>This is Shinra No. 2... Everything's normal. </sp>

Over and out... </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Junon Airport... We should make it if we hurry.<boxstart/>Forget about the Huge Materia for now.<boxstart/>We're climbing! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Tifa">Tifa</speaker><boxstart/>Aye, aye... CAPTAIN! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Nanaki">Nanaki</speaker><boxstart/>Take o-ff! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>The airport? No sweat! </sp>
<stage>They return to the surface and dock the submarine outside Junon. They hurry back to Junon.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Fisherman">Fisherman</speaker><boxstart/>It seems like there's something going on again up there.<boxstart/>Is that huge plane going to take off again with that deafening roar? </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Older Man">Older Man</speaker><boxstart/>I just saw some Shinra soldiers all huddled together discussing something.<boxstart/>They said a plane carrying Huge Materia would be taking off from the airport above. </sp>
<stage>They take the elevator to Upper Junon.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier on the Path to the Airport">Soldier on the Path to the Airport</speaker><boxstart/>Finished loading the Huge Materia!<boxstart/>All we have to do now is to ready the cargo ship, 'Gelnika', for departure and we're done! </sp>
<stage>Cloud arrives at the airport only to watch Gelnika take off from Junon.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Oh no! The Huge Materia... </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Barret">Barret</speaker><boxstart/>Let's go after it! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Yuffie">Yuffie</speaker><boxstart/>Let's get there before they do and catch 'em! </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cait Sith">Cait Sith</speaker><boxstart/>How 'bout us getting there beforehand and stealing it back? </sp>

<sp><speaker name="Cid">Cid</speaker><boxstart/>Where's that thing headed? </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Rocket Town, of course. </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>Whew... I hope everything goes all right until we get to Rocket Town. Then, our mission is nearly complete. </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier 2">Soldier 2</speaker><boxstart/>Not so fast. We still have one major task... we still have to transport the stuff... </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier">Soldier</speaker><boxstart/>The stuff... </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Soldier on the Path to the Airport">Soldier on the Path to the Airport</speaker><boxstart/>I'm glad we got Gelnika to the Rocket Town safely.<boxstart/>But they sure think big. Looks like they're going to use the Huge Materia's to break up Meteor... </sp>
<stage>Cloud and the others leave Junon.</stage>
<stage>Searching the ocean floor, they find the red submarine.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>So this is the Leader Sub...<boxstart/>Damn...... makes me sick just thinking about it... </sp>
<sp><speaker name="unspecified"/><boxstart/>...Huge Materia recovered...<boxstart/>...no damage appears to have been sustained... </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>...Phew... That's good to hear. </sp>
<sp><speaker name="unspecified"/><boxstart/>Received Key Item "Huge Materia"! </sp>
<stage>They also come across the sunken ship Gelnika.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>This is the Shinra's Gelnika type airplane... I wonder why it went down here? </sp>
<stage>They enter a side room.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>What is this place...? Must be some kind of a Research Establishment because there's a Mako generator? </sp>
<stage>In the hallway, they encounter the Turks.</stage>
<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>Turks!? </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>...again? </sp>

<sp><speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>...but, it was attacked by Weapon and sunk to the bottom of the sea. </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Reno">Reno</speaker><boxstart/>I can't give you what's here. We'll take out <referent name="Sephiroth">Sephiroth</referent>.<boxstart/>I guess this is our last meeting. </sp>
<sp><speaker name="Rude">Rude</speaker><boxstart/>I won't let you get in our way. </sp>

<sp><speaker name="Cloud">Cloud</speaker><boxstart/>This must be the Cargo Room...<boxstart/>This is terrible... It's all messed up... </sp>
