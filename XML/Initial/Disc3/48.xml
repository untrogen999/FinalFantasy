<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Heh heh...... heh heh heh... Time's got a way of sneakin' up on ya, huh?<br/>I'm shakin' all over... Heh heh... I feel sick...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Hey, Cloud... Would you tell me 'It's all right'?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Say it cool<br/>- Say it normal<br/>- Don't say it</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Say it cool</span></p>
  <p class="italic">Cloud strikes a pose.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>It's all right, Tifa.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Now I feel like things are really going to be all right.<br/>Thanks, Cloud.<br/>I'm all right. I'm not going to chicken out at the last minute.</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Say it normal</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...It's all right.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Tifa</b><br/>You're right, things will be all right.<br/>I'm... all right... really... I'll fight my hardest...</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Don't say it</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...I just can't say it that easy.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Tifa</b><br/>I'm sorry... I guess you're right.<br/>......Wow. I guess... I am a little scared. My knees are trembling.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>I am Nanaki, son of Seto... I am afraid of nothing...<br/>It's all right, all right. I'm Nanaki, the son of brave Seto... I'm not afraid of Sephiroth...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>But I ain't gonna forget, no matter what happens.<br/>Not about this here trip, or them folks--none of it!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>Cloud...... take the ship to the Northern Cave.<br/>The time for flying is now past.<br/>Our battlefield is now beneath the earth...<br/>The gate to tomorrow is not the light of heaven, but the darkness of the depths of the earth......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>You ever see the play 'LOVELESS'?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- No<br/>- Yes</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">No</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cid</b><br/>Yeah, I figured someone like you wouldn't be much on plays.</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Yes</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cid</b><br/>Yeah? Really? Well, that's fine.<br/>They've been doin' that play every summer since I was a kid.<br/>An' I remember seein' it just once...<br/>That was when I was in Midgar interviewing to be a pilot.<br/>I had some free time and thought I'd catch the play.<br/>Now, I'm no big fan of the theater or anything.<br/>But this thing put me to sleep, just like I thought it would.<br/>Finally during the last scene, the guy next to me woke me up tellin' me my snorin' was too loud.<br/>So about all I really remember of that play is the end...<br/>The sister of the lead asks her lover,<br/>Do you really have to leave?<br/>And the guy says,<br/>I promised. The people I love, are waiting.<br/>......I don't understand. Not at all. But...... please take care of yourself.<br/>Of course... I'll come back to you. Even if you don't promise to wait. I'll return knowing that you'll be here.<br/>I remember thinking when I heard those lines,<br/>*&amp;%! What the hell's he talkin' about? But, you know... now I'm not so sure...<br/>I think I understand......</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>When this job's done, I'm landing the ship... yeah, that's what I'll do.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>Cloud...... sign this.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>What is it?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>It's a contract that says when the war is over, all the materia will belong to me.<br/>It's all in there. Read it carefully and then sign it, all right?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Forget it, I'm not even gonna read it.<br/>Whenever I read, I get airsick.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>Oh yeah......?<br/>I'm the same way, so I can't say too much......<br/>Damn! My plan failed. Let's pick on Nanaki later to let off steam.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Full Fledged Pilot</b><br/>Cloud, what do you want to do?<br/>- Go on<br/>- Wait a minute</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Crew Member</b><br/>I wonder what everyone's going to do when this fight's over?<br/>I wonder what's gonna happen to the Highwind...?</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud heads out to the deck.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Crew Member</b><br/>Take care!</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="descent"></a>Cloud starts down into Northern Cavern.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Looks like we can only slide down.<br/>- Alright, let's go!<br/>- We'll get prepared first</p>
<p class="italic">They slide down and begin their descent into the crater. At length they come to a fork in the path.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>The road splits into two. We'll split into two groups.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Which you gonna choose, Cloud?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Left<br/>- Right</p>
<p class="italic">The others split up, too.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Now don't any of you die on me.......<br/>Gotta get through to Sephiroth!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Well...... Looks like this is our last big job!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He runs off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Let's all go back alive, okay?</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She runs off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>All life on this planet, indeed the very life of this planet is in our hands...</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He runs off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>Oh man... 'Materia Hunter Yuffie' sounds like the last chapter of 'Materia Forever.'</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She runs off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>I'm so happy to have met you all, really! ...sniff...</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He runs off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>It's all over now. With this...</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He runs off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>I'll destroy that Sephiroth before anyone gets to him!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He runs off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>This will be the end of it!</p>
<p class="italic">If Cloud attempts to go down the path he didn't choose, he will stop and say:</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>We'll leave this to [name].</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud and his chosen party head off down one path. If they go left, they come to another fork.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Another fork in the road...</p>
<p class="italic">They choose directions again.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Sephiroth's probably crapping his pants right about now...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Wait! Sephiroth...</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud and his party reach a ledge very close to the bottom of the crater just ahead of the others.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Don't leave us, Cloud.</p>
<p class="italic">The others join Cloud at the bottom.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>This is the center of the Planet...?</p>
<p class="italic">Each member of the group which went down the opposite path has had something for Cloud until...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Here, Cloud.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Cloud, look.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Cloud, I found this...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>Hey, Cloud, I found this.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>Hold on to this.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>......... Wh... What?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Oh yeah, Yuffie, didn't you find somethin'?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>By the way Yuffie, didn't you find something on the way?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>Oh, all right.<br/>Here, Cloud.</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p>Received "Last Elixir"!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>But I'm the one who found it, so you better give it back to me when you're done with it!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Awright, this's the last dance!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>This is it.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>We finally made it here.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>Well, shall we get goin'?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>Hmm... Being with you all is not so bad.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Let's just get this over with!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Let's get going<br/>- (No, not yet...)</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>All right, everyone, let's mosey.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Damn! Again!<br/>Stop sayin' it like a wimp!<br/>Can't you say 'Move out!' or somethin'?</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud scratches his head.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Move out!!</p>
<p class="italic">There are growling and hissing noises from above them.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>What?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Look at the number...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>%#@^! They're comin' out in full force!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Cloud! You go first!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I'm fighting here too.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Shu'up! It won't do us no good wit' everyone back here!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Barret's right.<br/>You take two of us with you and go first. The rest'll catch up with ya later.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Is this like a practice run before the real thing?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>Yeah, a major practice run...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>Heh heh, I'm fine with that. (It's probably more fun than fighting Sephiroth down there.)</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>Hmm, this might be fun to pass time.</p>
<p class="italic">The growling gets louder.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>They're coming! They're already on the floor next to us!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Cloud! Hurry up and make up your mind!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>All of you!<br/>Later!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Yeah, later.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Yup! Later!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud and his chosen party start down. They reach a more substantial platform farther down and look around.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Where are we...?</p>
<p class="italic">There is a screeching noise.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>What's that!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>What!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>What! What!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Jenova...!?<br/>It's coming!!</p>
<p class="italic">A battle with Jenova ensues. After defeating her, the ground beneath them falls apart and they fall downwards into a bright blue light.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Li...... ight...<br/>A light...<br/>Is this......<br/>Is this light...... Holy?</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="sephiroth"></a>They come to on stone platforms surrounding a caged Holy.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Oww... damn, man!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Barret!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>What...? So everyone's together again...?</p>
<p class="italic">A pulse of energy goes through them all, lifting them into the air.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Everyone</b><br/>Uuuugh...!!</p>
<p class="italic">Sephiroth appears in front of Holy.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...Sephiroth!!</p>
<p class="italic">Another pulse of energy.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Ugh...! Is this...... the true power of Sephiroth?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>My... my body... I can't control my body...... Uuugh!?</p>
<p class="italic">Another pulse.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>My front legs...... my hind legs...... my tail's about to tear off!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>This is definitely not good...... He's way outta our league...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>I, I don't know if I can... go on...</p>
<p class="italic">A sharper pulse, and they all double over.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Cloud... Cloud...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Ugh... ugh...</p>
<p class="italic">Another pulse, and Cloud stops writhing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...there...<br/>It's...... there...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Cloud...?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...Holy...... Holy... is there......<br/>The Holy is shining......<br/>Aerith's prayer is shining......!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Holy...... Aerith......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>It's not over yet... This isn't the end yet!!</p>
<p class="italic">They prepare themselves for battle.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Let's go everyone...!<br/>- Just one more time...!</p>
<p class="italic">One final pulse.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Everyone</b><br/>Uuaaaahhhhhh!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Not only Aerith...<br/>Holy is the prayer of AVALANCHE...of Marlene and Dyne... And everyone on the planet!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>We're not gonna lose!!<br/>Aerith is here... everyone is here... Cloud is here with us!<br/>There's still many things for us to do... I'm not giving up!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>I'm going to see it through to the end. For our future... And that of the planet...<br/>I understand now, Grandpa. This is my mission!<br/>I won't let the Lifestream... or the Life of the Planet wither away!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>I don't like it!!<br/>Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have come...<br/>I don't need... materia...... any...<br/>Nope, I still want it!! This an' that an' everything... MINE! And I'm never gonna give any up!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>We're not losin'!!<br/>Maybe we were a little late in noticing the trouble we were getting into...<br/>But there's still time... We should be able to get out of it! Even if we can't get EVERYTHING back to normal!<br/>We should be able to protect what's most important!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>I was frozen in time... But now I feel as though my time is finally about to begin...!<br/>Sephiroth, now it's your time to sleep between the ages!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Hoo-ok......!<br/>I can't be foolin' around in the bottom of this hell hole...<br/>I still have lots of stuff to do with my life!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Aerith's memories... Our memories...<br/>We came... to tell you... our memories... Come Planet! Show us your answer!<br/>And Sephiroth!! To the settling of everything!!</p>
<p class="italic">They fight Sephiroth, and after a long battle, finally defeat him.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>This is all we could do.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Wait! What about Holy? What's gonna happen to the Planet?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>That... I don't know. Isn't the rest up to the Planet?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>...You're right.<br/>We've done all that we could do.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>All right, everyone.<br/>It's no use thinking about it.<br/>We'll leave all our worries here.<br/>Let's go home proud.</p>
<p class="italic">They all start up the path. A flash of white, and Cloud stops.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>What happened?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>......I feel it...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>What......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>He is still...... here.</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud clutches his head.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Still......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Cloud!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>He's... laughing...</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud's spirit tears away as his body collapses.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Cloud!</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="end"></a>Cloud is carried deep into the Lifestream to fight a duel with Sephiroth. Sephiroth, defeated, dissolves into the Lifestream, which then surrounds Cloud.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>.........Lifestream?</p>
<p class="italic">He holds out his hand, thinking he sees Aerith reaching down for him, but he soon comes back to reality to realize that it's Tifa's hand, and the ground is crumbling beneath his feet. The rock gives way beneath Tifa, but Cloud catches her and manages to grab hold of the ledge.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>......I think I'm beginning to understand.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>What?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>An answer from the Planet...<br/>the Promised Land...<br/>I think I can meet her...there.</p>
<p class="italic">Tifa hesitates, her expression wistful, and then she closes her eyes and leans her head against Cloud.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Yeah, let's go meet her.</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud helps Tifa up to the ledge, and they pull themselves up.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Hey, where is everyone?</p>
<p class="italic">They both turn to look at the ledge across from them, where the others are gathered.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Heeeey!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b> (waving)<br/>I'm glad you're all safe!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b> (turning to Cid)<br/>They all seem to be safe, too.<br/>But...now what're we going to do?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Holy should be moving soon<br/>and that means this place will...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Oh, Lady Luck don't fail me now...</p>
<p class="italic">As Cid looks up, his mouth drops open and his cigarette falls from it. Everyone looks up to watch the Highwind come crashing down, Lady Luck painted on its side. Once they are all on board, Holy bursts from the crater, bringing them with it. The Highwind starts coming apart.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Shit!!</p>
<p class="italic">Cid reaches for an emergency lever and pulls it. The Highwind transforms into a plane and flies away from the crater.</p>
<p class="italic">Meanwhile, in a house in Kalm, Marlene looks up from where she is sitting at a table.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Marlene</b><br/>The flower girl?</p>
<p class="italic">Going to the window, she looks west towards Midgar. Meteor is bearing down on the city, a violent storm beneath it wreaking havoc upon Midgar. Holy rushes in from the north, trying to shield the city, but Meteor pushes through.</p>
<p class="italic">Back on the Highwind...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Wait a damn minute!<br/>What's going to happen to Midgar?<br/>We can't let that happen!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>I had everyone take refuge in the slums,<br/>but the way things are now...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>It's too late for Holy.<br/>Meteor is approaching the Planet.<br/>Holy is having the opposite effect.<br/>Forget Midgar,<br/>we've gotta worry about the Planet.</p>
<p class="italic">They stand around anxiously, watching helplessly. Suddenly, Tifa spots something.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>What's that!?</p>
<p class="italic">They all turn to look as tendrils of the Lifestream come up out of the earth.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>What the hell IS that......?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>......Lifestream.</p>
<p class="italic">As more of the Lifestream comes up, the people of Kalm sense something and open up their windows.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Marlene</b><br/>It's coming.</p>
<p class="italic">The Lifestream converges on Midgar. A blinding light flashes over the Planet, and everyone flinches. And, somewhere, Aerith lifts her head and smiles.</p>
<p class="block-grey">Five hundred years later...</p>
<p class="italic">Nanaki, his mane bedecked with a full eight feathers, is running through a canyon with two cubs trailing behind him. He leads them up to the top of a rise, and the three of them look down upon Midgar, which is by now overrun with vibrant green vegetation.</p>
