<p class="italic"><b>* Note</b>: Because the party can trigger these events by visiting Gongaga any time before getting the Keystone, Vincent and Cid's responses are included here as well. Red XIII also has slightly different dialogue after completing the events at Cosmo Canyon.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...Is someone there?</p>
<p class="italic">Farther along the path, Reno and Rude stand talking.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reno</b><br/>Hey, Rude. Who do you like?</p>
<p class="italic">Rude turns away.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reno</b><br/>What are you getting so embarrassed about? Come on? Who do you like?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Rude</b><br/>.........Tifa.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reno</b><br/>Hmmmm...<br/>That's a tough one.<br/>But, poor Elena. She...... you......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Rude</b><br/>No, she likes Tseng.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reno</b><br/>I never knew that! But Tseng likes that Ancient...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>What are they talking about?</p>
<p class="italic">Elena comes up from behind him, and he turns around in surprise.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elena</b><br/>It's so stupid!<br/>They always talk about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is different.<br/>Ah! Oh no!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She runs past Cloud to join Reno and Rude.</p>
<p class="block-inline">They're here! They're really here!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reno</b><br/>Hmm... Then it's time...<br/>Rude... Don't go easy on them even though they're girls.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Rude</b><br/>...Don't worry, I'll do my job.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elena</b><br/>Then, we're counting on you. I'll report to Tseng!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She runs off down the right fork of the path.</p>

<p class="italic"><a name="reactor"></a>The right fork of the path leads to the ruins of a Mako reactor.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>A ruined reactor.</p>
<p class="italic">A helicopter lands outside the reactor, and Scarlet and Tseng get off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>It's Scarlet, Head of Shinra Weapon Development.</p>
<p class="italic">He runs and hides in the rubble. Scarlet enters the reactor, Tseng following.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>......Hmph! This isn't any good either.<br/>You only get junky materia from junky reactors.<br/>This reactor's a failure.<br/>What I'm looking for is big, large, huge materia. You seen any?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tseng</b><br/>...No I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>Please. We could make the ultimate weapon if we only had some.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tseng</b><br/>I just can't wait.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>With Hojo gone, the Weapon Development's been betting a bigger budget.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tseng</b><br/>I envy them.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>But, even if we make the perfect weapon, could that stupid Heidegger even use it?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tseng</b><br/>......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>Oh... sorry! I forgot Heidegger was your boss! Ha ha ha!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tseng</b><br/>......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>Let's go!</p>
<p class="italic">She walks back towards the helicopter, and Tseng follows.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...Big, large, huge materia?<br/>An ultimate weapon? The perfect weapon?<br/>Just what are the Shinra up to...?</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He waits for the helicopter to leave before getting out of his hiding place. He inspects the rubble.</p>
<p class="block-inline">There's something shiny back there...<br/>- Don't do anything<br/>- Reach for it</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p>Received "Titan" Materia!</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Old Man</b><br/>............<br/>No matter how much I pray, it won't bring our grandson back...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>Three years ago when the reactor exploded, my husband...<br/>Do people really need reactors to live?<br/>Aren't there more important things in life...?</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>A ruined reactor.</p>
<p class="italic">Inside the weapons shop...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Accessory Shopkeeper</b><br/>Huh...... did you want something?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Buy accessories?<br/>- Hear a story?<br/>- Nothing in particular</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Hear a story?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Weapons Shopkeeper</b><br/>It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find pieces of it left all over town.</p>
<p class="italic">At the inn...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Innkeeper</b><br/>Uh... need somethin'?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Hear a story?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Innkeeper</b><br/>One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in it...</p>
<p class="italic">At the Mayor's house...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Mayor</b><br/>This is Gongaga Village. Many people died here in a Mako reactor explosion.<br/>The Shinra people told us that everyone would be happy once the Reactor was built. But, all it brought us was sadness......</p>
<p class="italic">In the Item Shop...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Item Shopkeeper</b><br/>Oh... you here to shop?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Hear a story?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Item Shopkeeper</b><br/>Shinra built the reactor without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>That's all right. It's all in the past now. I was just worried because I heard he's been missing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Missing?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>I think it was 5 years ago. He went out on a job, and never came back.<br/>He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone else...<br/>Hey? What's wrong?</p>
