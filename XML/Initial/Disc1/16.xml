<p class="indent"><b>Chocobo Mascot</b><br/>Welcome to the Gold Saucer.</p>
<p class="italic">If Cloud attempts to enter without paying, he's stopped by the admissions lady.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Admissions Lady</b><br/>Please buy your ticket here.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Admissions Lady</b><br/>Welcome to the Gold Saucer.<br/>Are you together? A single pass is 3000 gil, or you can purchase a lifetime pass for 30000 gil.</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Admissions Lady</b><br/>Thank you very much.<br/>If you have a Gold Ticket, you can come and go freely into the park... as long as you don't lose it.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Admissions Lady</b><br/>Here at the Gold Saucer, there are many places where you must pay with GP.<br/>Just think of 'GP' as money that you can only use at the Gold Saucer.<br/>GP can only be redeemed at the games in Wonder Square and at the Chocobo Races.<br/>Your GP limit is 10000, so please be careful.<br/>Please enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p class="italic">Moving on through the entrance, they find themselves in the central hub of Gold Saucer, called the Station.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Wow! Let's have fun!<br/>I know this isn't the right time to do this.<br/>Hey, Barret, cheer up!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>......I ain't in no cheery mood. So jes' leave me alone.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Really? That's too bad.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>...whisper... whisper... (Just act normal when this happens)</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Of course!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She runs back over to Barret.</p>
<p class="block-inline">We're gonna go play...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>So PLAY! ...messin' round #@^%$!<br/>Don't forget we're after Sephiroth!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He runs over and jumps down the tube leading to Wonder Square.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>...I think he's mad.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>He'll be fine. He seems to be doing a little better now.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>I wish we could just forget everything and have fun!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>We'd better be careful, Sephiroth might be around.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Sh...!<br/>Shinra soldiers... Even here...</p>

<p class="italic">The soldiers disperse to different areas of the Gold Saucer, and after a moment Cloud heads up the stairs.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lady at Entrance</b><br/>Welcome to Chocobo Racing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man Betting</b><br/>I... I lost...</p>
<p class="italic-inline">Or, sometimes:</p>
<p class="block-inline">Yeahh! This is why I can't seem to quit.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>You can only buy up to 3 tickets. Think before you buy. For example, you could select half of the Chocobos and buy 3 boxes.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Boxes?<br/>- Not interested</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>A box is buying 3 combinations of 2 chocobos.<br/>For example, if you select Chocobo 1, 3, and 5, you can purchase combinations, such as 1-3, 1-5, 3-5.<br/>You can also play the limited wheel by selecting a Chocobo.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Limited wheel?<br/>- Not interested</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>Playing a 'Limited wheel' means you select a Chocobo and use it in all of your combinations.<br/>For example, if you have Chocobo 1, then you buy 1-2, 1-3, 1-4.<br/>No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. It all comes down to insight and luck.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Security</b> (near Jockey Lounge)<br/>I'm sorry, but this is for authorized personnel only.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Blond Man</b><br/>We usually buy tickets for the B rank and C rank races, right?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Rank?<br/>- Not interested</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Blond Man</b><br/>In other words, 'rank' means the Chocobo's 'strength'. A is highest and C's the lowest.<br/>When you become a Free Chocobo jockey, you'll be able to buy A rank tickets.<br/>Of course, the higher the rank, the better your item ticket. Hey, maybe I'll become a Chocobo jockey!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- How DO you become one?<br/>- Not interested</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Blond Man</b><br/>You can become one if you own a Chocobo... and have some connections. But Chocobo's are pretty hard to catch and I don't have any connections.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Woman</b><br/>Hey, what's that Chocobo on the odds sheet?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>That's how you can find out a Chocobo's condition and strengths.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Woman</b><br/>Hmm, If you can tell which ones are the strongest, then it's easy...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the Chocobo's strength,<br/>but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's personality.<br/>If these are bad, they may use too much stamina, and affect other things.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lady at the Ticket Desk</b><br/>Welcome. Would you like to buy some Chocobo tickets?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yeah<br/>- Ask how to buy<br/>- Explain it to me<br/>- Not interested</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Yeah</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Lady at the Ticket Desk</b><br/>Registration fees are 200 gil. Is that all right?</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yeahhh!<br/>- No way!</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Lady at the Ticket Desk</b><br/>Which rank would you like to select?</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- C (1BET 1 0 0 gil)<br/>- B (1BET 2 0 0 gil)<br/>- Quit</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Ask how to buy</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Lady at the Ticket Desk</b><br/>You are allowed a maximum of 3 bets on your Chocobo ticket.</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Explain it to me</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Lady at the Ticket Desk</b><br/>This Chocobo Race has Virtual devices on the course.<br/>They show natural scenery during the race that really doesn't exist.<br/>You pick which Chocobo will finish first and second here,<br/>And then buy the appropriate tickets.<br/>And if the ticket you purchased is a winner, you'll receive a ticket for an item that will be listed on the panel.<br/>You can exchange your tickets for items or GP at the Exchange counter to the right of the entrance.</p>

<p class="italic">At Battle Square, there is a staff woman standing in front of the stairs.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Woman</b><br/>I'm sorry, we're currently renovating. Please come again.</p>
<p class="italic">At Ghost Square, a zombie greets Cloud as he enters the hotel.</p>

<p class="italic">At Speed Square, a muscular man addresses Cloud when he arrives.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>Hey boy.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Boy...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>How is it? You having fun?<br/>Mmm, so, you ARE having fun. Well, good, good for you boy.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>My name's Cloud. And stop calling me boy.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Dio</b><br/>Mmm? Me? I'm the owner of the Gold Saucer. The name's Dio.<br/>Just call me 'Dio'.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...... (Not even listening)</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Dio</b><br/>By the way, boy, do you know what a 'Black Materia' is?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- I know what it is<br/>- What is it?</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">I know what it is</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Dio</b><br/>Oh, so you do know.</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Dio</b><br/>Ha ha ha...... that, I say, that's a good one, boy! But it's not good to lie. You can't fool me.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Why d'you ask me?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Dio</b><br/>Well, a while back, a boy your age came in and asked me if I had a 'Black Materia.'<br/>I thought you might know who he was, seein' as how you're both about the same age.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Did he happen to have... a Black Cape...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Dio</b><br/>Why yes, yes indeed. And a tattoo on his hand that said '1'.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Where did he go!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Dio</b><br/>Ha ha ha, I have no idea.<br/>Well then.<br/>I say, stop by the Battle Arena if you like, boy.<br/>You'll probably like it. Many of my collections are on display there.<br/>Ha, ha ha.</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He leaves.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Person</b><br/>We have to be careful of these steps.<br/>What...? A lot of things...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>First, I gotta memorize the order it comes out, and then guess on the attacks...... mumble, mumble......</p>
<p class="italic">Onward to the roller coaster. If Cloud tries to get on without buying a ticket...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ticket Person</b><br/>This way, Sir, to register.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ticket Person</b><br/>Is this your first time? First, listen to the explanation of the game over there.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lady</b><br/>Hear the rules for this attraction?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yes<br/>- Not interested</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lady</b><br/>This attraction, Shooting Coaster is<br/>While your ride's going ZOOM, you're going BANG BANG, and things are going PHEW PHEW and you destroy them with a big BOOM. Pretty simple, isn't it?<br/>Oh, to shoot, hit the O Button. And, the Bar that's shown on the left side of the screen is the Power Meter.<br/>When it's full, it'll go BROOOOOM and when it's empty, it'll only go BRM and become weak. So be careful.<br/>Also, if you're in the Top 3 you'll get on the Wall of Fame.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ticket Person</b><br/>This attraction costs 10 GP.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Pay<br/>- Changed my mind</p>
<div class="block"/>
	<p class="italic"><span class="highlight">If Cloud does not have enough GP to pay.</span></p>

	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Ticket Person</b><br/>Thank you.</p>

<p class="italic">Cloud and the others ride the coaster.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Wall of Fame Staffer</b><br/>Your score is x points.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Wall of Fame Staffer</b><br/>Would you like to see the Wall of Fame?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yes<br/>- Not interested</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Wall of Fame Staffer</b><br/>You'll receive a prize if you get more than 3000 Points. So good luck.</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Narration</b><br/>Tired but relaxed, our little Mog turns out the lights early and goes to bed. Good night, and sweet dreams......</p>
  <p class="italic">A pink moogle appears.</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Narration</b><br/>Seems he likes her too...<br/>Now, will Mog be able to fly gracefully in front of her? Help him out with a few kupo nuts.</p>

    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Narration</b><br/>Best of luck to the both of you, Mog and Mag. May you have lots and lots of healthy Mogs!</p>
    <p class="italic">No fewer than 12 baby moogles exit the house. The last one trips and falls on his face. One of the others comes back for him and they run off.</p>
    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Narration</b><br/>Uh...no worries there, I guess...</p>
