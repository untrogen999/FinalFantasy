<p class="italic"><a name="chocobo"></a>Travelling across the grasslands from Kalm, Cloud and the others come across a chocobo farm. In a pen outside, several chocobos are walking about.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Chocobo</b><br/>Wark!<br/>Wark? Warkwark wark?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Wark<br/>- Warrrk</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Wark</span></p>
  <p class="italic">The chocobos perform a sort of waltz.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Chocobo</b><br/>Wark-----</p>
  <div class="highlight-nopad"/><p>Received "Choco/Mog" Materia!</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Warrrk</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Chocobo</b><br/>Wark!! Wark!!</p>

<p class="italic">They go inside the house, where they find the owner of the farm.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Choco Bill</b><br/>Thinking of crossing the marshes?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yeah<br/>- Not interested</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Yeah</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Bill</b><br/>Hmm, then it'll probably be safer for you to get a Chocobo.<br/>That way you can zip through the marshes with the Chocobo.<br/>It's the only way to avoid being attacked by the Midgar Zolom.<br/>Midgar Zolom...?<br/>It's a serpent-like creature over 30 feet tall!!<br/>It picks up on footsteps that enter the marshes...<br/>And then, BAM!! It attacks!!!<br/>To avoid that, buy a Chocobo at the Choco Bill &amp; Choco Billy Chocobo Farm.<br/>To purchase a Chocobo, please talk to my grandson. He's in the Chocobo stables at the far right end of the farm.<br/>By the way, there was another person heading towards the Marshes.<br/>Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him. It was a man in a Black Cape.</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Not interested</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Bill</b><br/>Hmm, then, I guess that's that.</p>

<p class="italic">Cloud goes to the stables, where two children are tending to the chocobos.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Chole</b><br/>Welcome.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>Do you want a Chocobo?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Mmm......<br/>- Give me one<br/>- Nope</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Give me one</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>You old folks are out of luck!</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Old folks...?</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Billy</b><br/>We're all out of Chocobos. I'm taking care of those ones out there for someone else.<br/>You know, if you really want a Chocobo, you should go out and catch one.<br/>Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Where are they?<br/>- How do I catch one?<br/>- What else?<br/>- Not interested</p>
  <div class="block"/>
    <p><span class="highlight">Where are they?</span></p>
    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>You see those claw prints out there? Wild Chocobo's will appear in those areas.<br/>But, if you don't have 'Chocobo Lure' they won't come out. They very cautious animals by nature.</p>
    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Chocobo Lure?<br/>- Go on</p>
    <div class="block"/>
      <p><span class="highlight">Chocobo Lure?</span></p>
      <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>'Chocobo Lure' is a type of materia which attracts Chocobos.<br/>If you equip this, they'll come to you. But, without it, they won't appear.</p>
    
    <div class="block"/>
      <p><span class="highlight">Go on</span></p>
      <p class="italic">Back to the tutorial menu; Cloud can ask any of his initial questions again.</p>
    
  
  <div class="block"/>
    <p><span class="highlight">How do I catch one?</span></p>
    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>A wild Chocobo always appears with other monsters.<br/>But, you won't be able to catch it because of the monsters.<br/>That is why you must defeat the monsters first before you catch the Chocobo.</p>
    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- And then?<br/>- That all you can talk about?</p>
    <div class="block"/>
      <p><span class="highlight">And then?</span></p>
      <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>Also, wild Chocobos are really cautious. They'll run away from the slightest things.<br/>But, if you use 'Greens' They'll focus on that, and won't run away.</p>
    
    <div class="block"/>
      <p><span class="highlight">That all you can talk about?</span></p>
      <p class="italic">Back to the tutorial menu; Cloud can ask any of his initial questions again.</p>
    
  
  <div class="block"/>
    <p><span class="highlight">What else?</span></p>
    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>Whatever you do, don't make Chocobos angry. They're usually calm, but if you get them angry, you'll get hurt.<br/>Oh, and remember, once you get off a Chocobo, it'll escape.</p>
  
  <div class="block"/>
    <p><span class="highlight">Not interested</span></p>
    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>Well then, shall we get down to business?<br/>I'll sell you the 'Chocobo Lure' for 2000 gil, right now.<br/>You want it?</p>
    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Buy it<br/>- Don't buy it</p>
    <div class="block"/>
      <p><span class="highlight">Buy it</span></p>
      <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>Thanks!<br/>It wouldn't hurt to buy some 'Greens' either.<br/>Oh, and how fast a Chocobo'll finish eating depends of what type of 'Greens' you feed them.</p>
    
    <div class="block"/>
      <p><span class="highlight">Don't buy it</span></p>
      <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>Mmmm, if you don't have it, you'll never catch one.</p>
    
  

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Nope</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Choco Billy</b><br/>Oh, I'm so glad!</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Chole</b><br/>Wasn't it really expensive?<br/>But don't be mad at my brother or Grandpa.<br/>Ever since dad and mom died, it's been like this...</p>
<p class="italic">After leaving the farm, Cloud catches a chocobo and they cross the marshes, avoiding the Midgar Zolom. On reaching the other side, they find the giant snake impaled on a dead tree and stop to stare.</p>
