<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>YO!<br/>Looks like this ain't no private car. So split up!!</p>
<p class="italic">Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie run off to another car.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Shinra Manager</b><br/>...hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck...</p>
<p class="italic">The Shinra manager sits down just as Barret runs over.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>You say sumthin'?<br/>I said, 'you say sumthin'!?<br/>Yo, look at that!! It got empty alluva sudden.<br/>What's goin' on?</p>
<p class="italic">The manager jumps.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Shinra Manager</b><br/>DAMN!!<br/>I... it's empty because of... g, guys like you...</p>
<p class="italic">Barret pounds the wall above the manager and he jumps again.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Shinra Manager</b><br/>Y, Y, YIPES!!<br/>You... you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be more bombings.<br/>Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like today.</p>
<p class="italic">Barret jumps back and aims his gunarm at the man.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>You workin' for Shinra?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Shinra Manager</b><br/>I won't give in to violence... and I'm not giving up my seat either!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Barret!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>&amp;$#%!! You lucky ^$#^$.!</p>
<p class="italic">Barret turns away from the man. Tifa runs over and bows apologetically before joining Barret and Cloud.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>So, what are we gonna do now?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm...</p>
<p class="italic">With a rumble, the train starts moving.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Seems like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally leaving.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>So what's our next target?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!<br/>Awright... I'll tell ya!<br/>Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security check point at the top plate.<br/>It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Which Shinra is very proud of.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>We can't use our fake ID's anymore...</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p>Good Morning, and welcome to Midgar lines. Arrival time at Sector 4 Station will 11:45.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>That means we've got only three more minutes to the ID Check point.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train.<br/>Got it!?</p>
<p class="italic">Barret sits down, and Tifa runs over to the railway map monitor.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Cloud, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Train Bum</b><br/>Hmmm......? You're the only ones that'll talk to me or come to my house.<br/>I'm impressed.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Yo, Mr. know-it-all, big time SOLDIER! You oughta know the area 'round the No. 5 Reactor, right!<br/>So let's hear YOUR explanation!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Shinra Manager</b><br/>Waaaaah!!<br/>Don... don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man...!! I'm gonna brag to everyone at work about this...)</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud joins Tifa by the map monitor.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already...<br/>It's all right. Come a little closer.</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud steps closer, but suddenly a red light starts flashing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down.</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p>Type A Security Alert!!<br/>Unidentified passengers confirmed... A search of all cars will be conducted!<br/>Repeat!! Type A Security Alert!!<br/>Unidentified passengers confirmed... A search of all cars will be conducted!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>What's happening?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>What's goin' on!!</p>
<p class="italic">Jessie runs in from the other car.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Jessie</b><br/>We're in trouble.<br/>I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>^%#@%! Someone blew it...</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Train Bum</b><br/>Hm?... You'd talk to me even now?<br/>I'm really impressed. Let me give you a little something as a reward.</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p>Received "Phoenix Down"!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Train Bum</b><br/>If I die in the gutter, use that to revive me, okay?</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud and the others move on to Car #2...</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Passenger</b><br/>Hey, you guys are rowdy!<br/>Well, just calm down.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Boy</b><br/>Hyu----n! Hyu----n!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Girl</b><br/>Does this mean we're in a major bind?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Person</b><br/>Gosh!! You guys are adults, but you're making such noise.<br/>Please behave while you're in the train.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Dark-clothed Man</b><br/>Huh?<br/>The hell!?<br/>Do you want this?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yeah...<br/>- My mistake</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Dark-clothed Man</b><br/>Wow! I won't even charge you...<br/>Wha-t? Don't get used to it though.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Awright! We clear!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Jessie</b><br/>Not yet. They're starting another check. If we're caught, we're done for!<br/>But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should get past it!</p>
<p class="italic">Jessie runs towards the next car, punching some guy in her way.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Naked Man 2</b><br/>Any idea what happened?<br/>All I know is, when I woke up the 3 of us were butt-naked!<br/>But I guess you couldn't relate...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Naked Man 3</b><br/>That scary broad made me take the bomb.<br/>Of course I couldn't very well refuse her!</p>
<p class="italic">On to Car #5, where Biggs and Jessie are dressed in Shinra uniforms. Wedge is dressed in overalls.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Wedge</b><br/>Guess who? It's me, Wedge!<br/>Looks like things were a success.<br/>I look just like my little brother in these clothes...<br/>I wonder how everyone's doin' now...?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Jessie</b><br/>It's me, Jessie. How do I look, Cloud?<br/>Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yeah...<br/>- Not now</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">Not now</span></p>
  <p>Just concentrate on our plan.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Jessie</b><br/>You're right, sorry.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>...Scary... huh.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Too late to be saying that now. Why'd you come along anyway?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Because...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Hey you two! There ain't no time for that!<br/>Yo!! Ain't no time to waste!!<br/>...do something!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Yeah!! I've made up my mind!<br/>Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She jumps from the train.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>You don't care if I go first?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>A leader always stays till the end.<br/>Don't worry 'bout me, just go!<br/>Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt!<br/>It's only the beginnin' of the mission!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud shrugs and jumps. Barret turns to Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Later! You take care of the rest!</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>We're gonna jump outta here!! Follow me!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>We got a lot of battles ahead of us. This's going to be tough.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Oh man...... We were forced to get this far out.<br/>We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on.<br/>Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!<br/>Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!</p>

<p class="italic">They jump from the train.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>That was close. I thought we were gonna get caught...<br/>They probably don't realize that we've sneaked in yet. We should get to the reactor in no time.<br/>Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!<br/>Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="tunnel"></a>Back to the main scenario. In the train tunnel...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Good, so far everything's going as planned.<br/>Better not let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 reactor.<br/>Biggs, Wedge and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it.<br/>Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Those light beams are the Shinra's security sensors. We can't go any further.<br/>After coming this far, only an amateur'd get caught by the security sensor.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that to get under the Plate? No way!<br/>Yo, Cloud, what're we gonna do?</p>

<p class="italic">Eventually Cloud and the others go down the hole and come out in the maintenance walkways beneath the Sector 4 plate.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Wedge</b><br/>Cloud, this way. The reactor's up this ladder.</p>
<p class="italic">Going up the ladder, they run across Jessie.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Jessie</b><br/>I'm sorry.<br/>The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault.<br/>I made your ID card special...... So that's why it happened...<br/>I put my heart into making it. But I failed.<br/>Next time, I'll give you something more decent.<br/>I'll be back at the hideout in my research room workin' on it.</p>
<p class="italic">Onward, down a different ladder...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Biggs</b><br/>We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout.<br/>Cloud, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor!</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="reactor"></a>They move onwards into the reactor. When they near its core, Cloud suddenly collapses.</p>

  <p class="italic">In the Nibelheim reactor of five years prior, Tifa is kneeling by her father's body.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Papa...<br/>Sephiroth!?<br/>Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?<br/>Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything!<br/>I hate them all!</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Damn man, get a hold of yourself!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>You all right?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>......Tifa.</p>

<p class="block-inline">I know. You're my watch, right?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Damn straight.<br/>Tifa's old friend... That ain't good enough.</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud sets the bomb, and they hurry out of the reactor. Coming out of the elevator, they reach a closed door, and a room on the side with three large buttons.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Jessie said we all have to push the buttons at once.</p>
<p class="italic">If Cloud fails to push the button at the right time...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>No good. Let's try it again.</p>
<p class="italic">Eventually they succeed and run on out of the reactor.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>This way!</p>

<p class="block-inline">Shinra soldiers!?<br/>SHIT! What the hell's goin' on?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...a trap...</p>
<p class="italic">They all turn to look as President Shinra comes out of the reactor.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Presi... President Shinra?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Why is the President here?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>President Shinra</b><br/>Hmm... So you all must be that... ...what was it?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! And you're President Shinra, huh?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Long time no see, President.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>President Shinra</b><br/>...Long time no see? Oh... you.<br/>You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew you'd been exposed to Mako, from the look in your eyes...<br/>Tell me, traitor... what was your name?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Cloud.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>President Shinra</b><br/>Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember each person's name.<br/>Unless you become another Sephiroth.<br/>Yes, Sephiroth... He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant...</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud takes a step back.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Sephiroth......?</p>
<p class="italic">Barret runs up, pushing Cloud aside.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place's goin' up with a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>President Shinra</b><br/>And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin like you...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>VERMIN!? That's all you can say... VERMIN!<br/>Y'all Shinra're the VERMIN, killing the planet! And that makes you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>President Shinra</b><br/>...You are beginning to bore me.<br/>I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me... I have a dinner I must attend.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>President Shinra</b><br/>But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all.</p>
<p class="italic">He snaps his fingers, and a whirring noise starts up.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>!? What's that noise?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>The hell is this!?</p>
<p class="italic">A robot zooms in from the left.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>President Shinra</b><br/>Meet 'Airbuster', a techno-soldier. Our Weapon Development Department created him.<br/>I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be of great use to us in future experiments.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...Techno-soldier?</p>
<p class="italic">A helicopter comes up from below to hover near President Shinra.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>President Shinra</b><br/>Now then, if you'll excuse me.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Wait, President!</p>
<p class="italic">Shinra climbs onto the helicopter, and it flies off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Yo, Cloud! We've gotta do somethin' 'bout him!</p>
<p class="italic">The techno-soldier lunges at Barret and Tifa.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Help, Cloud!<br/>THIS is from SOLDIER?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>No way! It's just a machine.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>I don't care what it is!! I'm gonna bust him up!</p>
<p class="italic">They fight and defeat the Airbuster, but it explodes. Cloud falls into the gap in the bridge created by the explosion but manages to catch the far edge with one hand.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>It's gonna blow! Let's go, Tifa!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Barret! Can't you do something?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Not a damn thing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Cloud! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much I want to tell you!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I know, Tifa......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Hey, you gonna be awright?</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Barret</b><br/>...Alright. Sorry 'bout all this.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Stop talkin' like this is the end!</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Barret</b><br/>Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for ya. Ya gotta do it yourself.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Barret...</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Alright, then, later.</p>
<p class="italic">The reactor explodes, and Cloud loses his grip, falling into Sector 5 below. Tifa reaches for him, but Barret pulls her back.</p>
