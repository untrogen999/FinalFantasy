<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>The gate to Sector 7's in there.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going home?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Oh no! 'What ever will I do!?' ...isn't that what you want me to say?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- See her home<br/>- Take her to Sector 7</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">See her home</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Isn't that a little out of the way?</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Yeah, I guess so.</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Take her to Sector 7</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Aerith</b><br/>I could do that. But won't I be in your way?</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>What do you mean in the way?</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Nothing!</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Can we take a break?</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She wanders into the playground and stops by the slide with a cat's face.</p>
<p class="block-inline">I can't believe it's still here.</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She runs around and climbs up on top of it.</p>
<p class="block-inline">Cloud, over here!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud shrugs and joins her.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>What rank were you?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Rank?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>You know, in SOLDIER.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Oh, I was...</p>
<p class="italic-inline">Flash.</p>
<p class="block-inline">First Class.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Just the same as him.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>The same as who?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>My first boyfriend.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>You were... serious?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>No. But I liked him for a while.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I probably knew him. What was his name?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>It doesn't really matter.</p>
<p class="italic">The gate to Sector 7 opens, and a chocobo-drawn carriage comes out. Tifa is riding in back, wearing a revealing blue dress. Cloud jumps to his feet.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Huh? Hey, back there......<br/>Tifa!?</p>
<p class="italic">The carriage pulls past them and into Wall Market.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>That girl in the cart was Tifa? Where was she going? She looked kind of odd...</p>
<p class="italic">Aerith jumps off the slide and runs after the carriage.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Wait!<br/>I'll go on alone! You go on home!</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="explore"></a>He sighs and follows her into Wall Market.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So we've got to find Tifa fast.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man outside Honey Bee Inn</b><br/>I just can't make up my mind... Mmm.<br/>Huh? About what?<br/>Hmmm, don't make me say it... It's the shop down on the right.</p>
<p class="italic">On to the Honey Bee Inn, a brothel outside of which a number of guys are hanging around.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Johnny</b><br/>Man... Should I go...... or not?<br/>...I get so mental at times like this. I'm hopeless!!<br/>Hey!! Aren't you...?<br/>What!! You mean you're... too?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yeah, me too.<br/>- Don't bring me down to your level</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Yeah, me too.</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Johnny</b><br/>You're Tifa's childhood friend, and you brought a new girlfriend to a place like this!?<br/>What kind of guy are you!!</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Don't bring me down to your level</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Johnny</b><br/>What... Me too. I decided this after a lot of deep thought. My last memories of Midgar... you know.<br/>But... That guy over there kinda scares me.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Punk</b><br/>What the hell!! You *%^&amp;!! This ain't no #$*&amp;^% show!! I'm busy right now!!<br/>I'm feelin' like there's gonna be a fight!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Shinra Soldier</b><br/>Urrrrgh... no way...... I can't go on.<br/>Things aren't working out.<br/>Between our differences and my pay, it just isn't cutting it.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Older Man</b><br/>Welcome!! Even unpopular dweebs, like you may meet their destiny here!!<br/>You looking for a girlfriend too?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- You know a girl named Tifa?<br/>- This place doesn't interest me.</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">You know a girl named Tifa?</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Older Man</b><br/>Hey, you're pretty fast. Tifa's our newest girl.<br/>But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now.<br/>Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion.<br/>Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down and is in the market for a bride.</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">This place doesn't interest me.</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Older Man</b><br/>Hmm... Seems to like it just fine. Good for you.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Redhead in Suit</b><br/>The Honey Bee Inn is a private club. Only members can go in. Shoo, shoo.</p>
<p class="italic">Back to the main streets...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kid by Cat Statue</b><br/>Aren't cats great? This one's a little big, huh?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Punk</b><br/>Hey boy! You shore got a good lookin' heifer there!<br/>Take her to the Don's place, and you'll make a mint.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man Cooking Outside</b><br/>It's a little early to start eating. Come back in a bit.</p>
<p class="italic">Inside the Materia Shop...</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Customer</b><br/>Don't push! Hooligan!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Shopkeeper's Daughter</b><br/>Welcome. Please take your time.</p>
<p class="italic">Back outside again...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>All this trash. Can't we do anything with it?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man 2</b><br/>All this, belongs to the owner of the Weapons Shop. He keeps picking things up and saving them here.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>Oh, you mean the owner who even has a tank in his shop.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man 2</b><br/>But no matter how you look at it, it's just trash...</p>
<p class="italic">Inside the gym...</p>

<p class="italic">Inside the bar...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Clothing Shop Owner</b><br/>Whew, times are bad.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>...And then...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead 2</b><br/>Hmm, hmmm, oh really?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barkeeper</b><br/>Yes? If you want to order, do it at the counter.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man Waiting Outside Bathroom</b><br/>Hey, could you do somethin' for me? Someone's been in there all day and they're not comin' out. I can't hold it anymore!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead in Bathroom</b><br/>HEY... someone's IN here... Don't look!<br/>Got any medicine on you? I'm too hyper... and...... ugh......</p>
<p class="italic">Inside the weapon shop...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Weapon Shop Owner</b><br/>You want somethin'? I don't wanna hear any complaints 'bout how things look.</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="plan"></a>At Don Corneo's mansion...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Doorman</b><br/>This is the mansion of Don Corneo, the most powerful man in Wall Market.<br/>Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around here again...<br/>Hey, and you got another cute one with you!</p>
<p class="italic">Aerith and Cloud step aside to talk.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Hey, this look's like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look.<br/>I'll tell Tifa about you.</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She starts for the door.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>No!! You can't!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Why?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>You DO know... what kind of... place this is, don't you?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Then what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in there, it'll cause too much commotion.<br/>But, I just can't let you go in alone... Oh, man......</p>
<p class="italic-inline">At this point, Aerith starts laughing, but Cloud continues without noticing.</p>
<p class="block-inline">First... we need to find out if Tifa's alright...<br/>What's so funny, Aerith?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Cloud, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>WHAT!?</p>
<p class="italic">Aerith runs over to the doorman before he can protest further.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Aerith! I can't......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>You ARE worried about Tifa, aren't you? Them come on, hurry!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Doorman</b><br/>A friend, huh...? Sounds pretty good to me.<br/>That'll make the Don happy, too. Who knows, maybe I can...... heeee, hee hee.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="honeybee"></a>Now that they know where Tifa is, it becomes possible to enter the Honey Bee Inn.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man outside Honey Bee Inn</b><br/>Nope, I just can't make up my mind. Here, you take this. You won't be able to get in without it.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Clothing Shop Owner</b><br/>No, what are you saying? This one.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>...I want THIS one.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Shopkeeper's Daughter + Clothing Shop Owner</b><br/>Huh?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>I'm going to go change.</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She walks to the dressing room, then turns to look at everyone.</p>
<p class="block-inline">......No peeking!</p>
<p class="italic">Everyone stares at the curtain while she changes, and after a few moments she emerges in a red dress with her hair down.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>So? How do I look?</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud just shakes his head.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Oh, you're no fun!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Shopkeeper's Daughter</b> (to Cloud)<br/>...Hmm. It's REALLY somethin'.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Customer</b><br/>You're...<br/>Weird.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Clothing Shop Owner</b><br/>Hmm, good. It looks good on you.</p>
<p class="italic">They leave the dress shop and can now wander around a bit without being recognized. If Cloud tries to leave Wall Market, Aerith hangs back.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>What's wrong, Aerith?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>...What is it? Are you going outside like that? I mean, that's okay with me, but...</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Get a hold of yourself, Ms. Cloud.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Punk</b><br/>Hey! Pretty lady. Let me tell you about a good job!<br/>Go to the Don's place. You'll make a small fortune!</p>
<p class="italic">Outside the Honey Bee Inn...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Men</b><br/>Yeow!! Hey, Princess!!</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Doorman</b><br/>Damn!! Your friend's hot, too!<br/>Come in, come in!!<br/>Two ladies coming through!!</p>
<p class="italic">The door opens, and Cloud and Aerith walk through.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead in Suit</b><br/>Hey, ladies.<br/>I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't go wandering around...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Now's our chance. Let's find Tifa.</p>
<p class="italic">Of two doors upstairs, one is closed, and the other reads "Office of The Don Corneo Keep Out!" Aerith and Cloud go down a long set of stairs to the basement, where they find Tifa. When Cloud sees her, he turns away. Aerith goes over to talk to her alone.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>...Tifa?<br/>Nice to meet you. I'm Aerith.<br/>Cloud's told me a lot about you.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>...And you are?<br/>Hey you're the one with Cloud in the park...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Right, with Cloud.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Oh......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>What do you mean, 'Don't worry'... about what?<br/>No, don't misunderstand.<br/>Cloud and I grew up together. Nothing more.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Poor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call him nothing.<br/>Right, Cloud?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Cloud?</p>
<p class="italic">If Cloud tries to run away upstairs, Aerith comes after him.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Embarrassed? Come on, speak up!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud walks up to Tifa, head down.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>????</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She peers at him and then jumps several feet in the air.</p>
<p class="block-inline">Cloud!?<br/>Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?<br/>Forget that, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you hurt!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Hey, give me a chance to answer.<br/>I'm dressed like this...... because there was no other way to get in here.<br/>I'm all right. Aerith helped me out.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Oh, Aerith did...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Tifa, explain. What are you doing in a place like this?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Yeah, ummm......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Ahem!! I'll just plug my ears.</p>
<p class="italic-inline">She walks a short distance away and puts her hands to her ears.</p>
<p class="block-inline">Please, go on with your private conversation.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>...I'm glad you're OK.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Thanks. What happened?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird man.<br/>So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>That's when the Don's name popped up.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Right, Don Corneo.<br/>Barret told me to leave the lech alone...<br/>But something's been bothering me.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's mouth.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind.<br/>Corneo is looking for a bride.<br/>Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then... ...and, well......<br/>Anyway, I have to be the girl... or I'm out for tonight.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Sorry... but I overheard...<br/>If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>I guess so, but...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>We have two here, right?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>No, Aerith! I can't have you get involved.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>No, I don't want Tifa in...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Is it all right?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger.<br/>Do you trust me?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aerith.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>Call me Aerith.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead in Suit</b><br/>He---y!!<br/>It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting!<br/>I told you not to wander around... I tell ya, women nowadays...<br/>Hurry up, will ya!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is......<br/>Me...... right?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>You're right, there was no need...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>...to ask.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Ha ha... You know, if you look closely, you're not so bad...<br/>I wonder what Barret would say if he could see you now...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Aerith</b><br/>They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.</p>
<p class="italic">The three of them head back upstairs.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead in Suit</b><br/>The Don's waiting in his room... Ha ha ha...</p>
<p class="italic">They enter Don Corneo's office, where he is seated at his desk, flanked by two lackeys.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kotch</b><br/>All right, ladies!<br/>Line up in front of the Don!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa line up in front of the desk, and Corneo jumps up.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Don Corneo</b><br/>Hmmm! Good, splendid!<br/>Now, let's see... Which girl should I choose? Hmm---hmm---!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He walks to Cloud, who turns his head.</p>
<p class="block-inline">This one?</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He walks to Tifa.</p>
<p class="block-inline">Or this one?<br/>Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!!<br/>My choice for tonight is......</p>
<p class="italic">Depending on the items collected for Cloud's disguise, Don Corneo will choose one of the three.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>So... talk.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Don Corneo</b><br/>...I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But that's what I was ordered to do.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>By who?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Don Corneo</b><br/>No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Talk! If you don't tell us...</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>The head of Public Safety Maintenance!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk!<br/>If you don't tell us...<br/>...I'll smash them.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Don Corneo</b><br/>...You're serious, aren't you... ...ohboy, ohbooy, ohboy.<br/>...I'm not fooling around here either, you know.<br/>Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout.<br/>And they're really going to crush them... literally,<br/>By breaking the support holding up the plate above them.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Break the support!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Don Corneo</b><br/>You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING<br/>and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums...<br/>I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?<br/>Cloud, will you come with me to Sector 7?</p>
