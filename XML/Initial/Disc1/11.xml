<p class="italic">On the way to Junon, Cloud and the others may happen across the entrance to Fort Condor.</p>
<p class="italic"><b>* Note</b>: Because they can bypass Fort Condor, it's possible to come for the first time at later points in the game, including while Tifa is the party leader, in which case the dialogue is slightly different. Red XIII also has slightly different dialogue after completing the events at Cosmo Canyon.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>We've been fighting the Shinra for a long time at this battlefield.<br/>Even now, we're still settled in for a long war with them.<br/>If you aren't in a hurry, would you help us fight them?<br/>Listen, we don't want to push you but, if you're in the middle of something, why don't you finish that first?</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Man with Hat</b><br/>I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a condor.<br/>It seems the Shinra doesn't like the idea of having a condor on top of the reactor.</p>
<blockquote class="party">
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Barret</b><br/>Damn, that's one big bird! But why are they trying to get rid of it with weapons?</p>

	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Tifa</b><br/>What's so wrong with having a condor on top of the reactor?</p>

	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Vincent</b><br/>......That's too much.</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cid</b><br/>Huh? I don't get it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent"><b>Man with Hat</b><br/>It seems there's some type of special materia in the reactor above us.<br/>And because the condors came, the Shinra rushed troops here.<br/>The military wants to get the condor and all the villagers off this mountain.<br/>The condors are now warming their eggs, which hatch only once every few years.<br/>We would like to protect the condors from being harmed.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>New lives......</p>

	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Barret</b><br/>I'll do it! I'll protect them from Shinra!</p>

	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Condors' eggs. A real work of nature.<br/>We've got to protect the life of the planet.</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Red XIII</b><br/>So, to protect the eggs, are you gonna protect the reactor?......</p>
	<p class="italic-inline-nopad">Or, after Cosmo Canyon:</p>
	<p class="block-inline-nopad">We're going to protect the reactor in order to save the eggs.</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>Special materia, huh? Well, well, things are getting interesting.</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>I'm gonna leave it up to you all.</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Vincent</b><br/>......and come out in one piece?</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cid</b><br/>You guys, what are ya gonna do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent"><b>Man with Hat</b><br/>Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra ourselves.<br/>That's why we have hired soldiers to help us.<br/>As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by fighting along side of us...<br/>What do you think?

  <p class="italic"><span class="highlight"><a name="fighting"></a>If he did agree to help...</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Man</b><br/>Thanks for accepting.<br/>Let me explain our strategy.<br/>The enemy will climb the mountain looking for the reactor. We will leave a trap for them and hire soldiers to protect the area.<br/>Well, that's all, but...... This village doesn't have any money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke.<br/>If we hired one soldier, we would need 400 gil. So, if we hire 20 soldiers, we must have 8000 gil.<br/>So if you folks have the time, we would like you to use your own money to hire these soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and command the troops.<br/>If you're pressed for time we'd like you to help us with the money.<br/>If you can give us the money, we can then hire soldiers with the funds and block Shinra's attack.<br/>We know that what we're asking is selfish.<br/>We have sent our wives and children to another village. We are resigned to our fate.<br/>Let's get back to square one. If the enemy penetrates our shed, you'll have to fight them immediately.<br/>Well, just because you lost once, it's not the end of the world, but if you lose repeatedly, it could be dangerous.<br/>Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Conditions for victory</span></p>
    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Man</b><br/>You can win by wiping out the enemy or killing the enemy commander in charge.<br/>If the enemy reaches the shed, they'll attack, and you'll have no choice but to go into battle immediately.<br/>In the event that you lose during direct contact, even if the enemy gets to the reactor, there's still a chance to save things.<br/>But it's only a slight chance, and we have no idea how much the reactor can endure in an attack.<br/>When we can't stand up to the attack any longer, the Shinra will take both the condors and our lives, as well as all the materia within the reactor.</p>

    <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Man</b><br/>First off, we must prepare the troops.<br/>Move the cursor wherever the x mark does not appear, then press the O button to set-up.<br/>After all positions are in place, select by pressing the X button. This starts the battle.<br/>Soldiers can only be arranged near the shed, in the beginning.<br/>That's because if the soldiers are too far away, they won't be able to follow instructions.<br/>You can only put soldiers on the horizontal line at the very bottom.<br/>Soldiers can be instructed by pushing the select button. So if any commands are unclear, push it.<br/>Soldiers can report by pushing the O button......<br/>The cursor will move to the soldier who made the report.<br/>Press the X button and you'll hear the report without moving.<br/>And you can bet Shinra will send platoons at you on a regular basis.<br/>It would be great if you could spare the time to help us...<br/>But if you really don't have time, would you contribute some financial assistance.</p>
