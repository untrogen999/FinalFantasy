<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>Hey, listen to me! The Shinra troops are on the move.<br/>The TV news said Rufus came up with 2 plans. One, is to launch a rocket into space containing Huge Materia......<br/>Is Huge Materia really that destructive?</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">At Corel...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>Shinra soldiers came around sayin' they were gathering up all the Huge Materia.<br/>I think they're gonna bring it here by coal train, from the Corel Reactor.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Big Man</b><br/>Some Shinra soldiers went up to Mt. Corel. They said they're collecting Huge Materia to blow up Meteor!<br/>Ya think they can really do it...? I'll bet the reactor destroys everything even before Meteor hits!</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="arrival"></a>Cid and the others travel through the mountains to the Corel Reactor.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier</b><br/>You guys are...!</p>
<p class="italic">They fight and defeat the two soldiers guarding the door.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Guess we're safe for now...!</p>

	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>Way to go, Mister! You used to drivin' this thing too?</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Don't worry! I can handle this kinda stuff!<br/>Two levers; one on the right and one on the left...<br/>I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right!?<br/>Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 minutes.<br/>We're gonna fly!!
