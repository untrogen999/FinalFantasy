<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Hey, HEY! What're ya tryin' to do? Break the Highwind? Let's fight on the ground!</p>
<p class="italic">They reach and fight Diamond Weapon some miles outside of Midgar, but cannot defeat it. It turns towards Midgar, leaving them behind.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Wassup, Mr. Monster? What're you lookin' at?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Something's wrong...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>Doesn't look like it's after us. Something else...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>No, it's...... feeling something. ......Yeah, it senses murder.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Let's go to the Airship!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>OK, can we go now!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>To my ship!</p>
<p class="italic">The others run out. Cloud's PHS rings.</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>Oh no! Let's hurry out of here!<br/>Something big... I'm talkin' REALLY BIG's comin'!</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="sisterray"></a>Meanwhile at Shinra HQ...</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p class="indent-nopad"><b>Heidegger</b><br/>Hah, hah, hah, Mr. President, preparations for Sister Ray are now in order.</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p class="indent-nopad"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>Hah, hah, hah!<br/>Anytime is fine.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Rufus</b> (laughing)<br/>......Fire.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">The Sister Ray fires a shot northward. The glass on the Shinra building shatters. Diamond Weapon fires back at Midgar. On the Highwind's deck...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Which direction is it going to attack from?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Midgar!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Marlene!!</p>
<p class="italic">The shot from the Sister Ray goes right through Diamond Weapon as the Highwind flies by. The Weapon falls.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Damn...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>It went right through Weapon......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I see! They're after Sephiroth! The crater on the Northern boundary!</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">The shot continues on to the Northern Crater and destroys the barrier. Back at Shinra HQ...</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p class="indent-nopad"><b>(operator)</b><br/>Sir! Weapon's been defeated!!<br/>The barrier has disappeared!</p>
<p class="italic-inline-nopad">There is a pause.</p>
<p class="block-inline-nopad">Sir! A mass of high density energy is heading towards Midgar!</p>
<p class="italic">Rufus turns and looks. In the street below, people are running away from the Shinra building.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>People Fleeing</b><br/>WHOOA-- Weapon's coming!<br/>Run for your lives!!</p>
<p class="italic">Rufus stands motionless in his office as the blast hits.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">Back on the Highwind...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>What happened to...... Sephiroth?<br/>Northern Cave...<br/>Let's go see what happened to it.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>When AVALANCHE was jes startin', we used to put up flyers everywhere.<br/>And now, we're up against Sephiroth. How about that?<br/>Feels like a long time ago.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Now we're going to fight Sephiroth.<br/>I wonder what the inside of that cave looks like? You think Sephiroth is just sitting there waiting for Meteor?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Will we save the world if we beat Sephiroth?<br/>I'm frightened, but I'll do my best. Let's hurry to the Northern Cave!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>......Wonder what that Sephiroth feller's up to?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>Defeat Sephiroth... Defeat the son of that beloved woman...<br/>Am I on the verge of committing another sin......?<br/>Or am I atoning as best I can for only watching...?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Maybe this is the time?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>What's the pilot like?<br/>Tell him Yuffie says if he pilots the plane smoothly, give him my autograph...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Learner Pilot (L14)</b><br/>Hey, Cloud!!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Y, yeah, let's go!<br/>- U, uh wait</p>
<p class="italic">They fly to the Northern Crater.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Sephiroth's energy barrier is gone......<br/>Cid! Can the Airship get inside?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Huh? He's my student, ain't he!? Of course he can go anywhere!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Right, sorry about that.</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="hq"></a>Cait Sith gives a sudden start.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Yo, Cait Sith! Now what?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>Hold it!<br/>Scarlet! Heidegger! What's going on?</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">Back at Shinra HQ...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Heidegger</b><br/>Strange. I can't reach the President!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reeve</b><br/>Not the President. To Sister Ray!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>Ha, ha, ha. What is it Reeve? You're speaking strangely.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reeve</b><br/>None of that matters!<br/>The reactor's output is increasing all by itself!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>Ww, wait a minute. That's not wise!<br/>It must cool for 3 hours or it won't work. Reeve, shut off the machine!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reeve</b><br/>We can't do that! It's inoperable!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He pulls out his cell phone.</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p>Someone has switched the machine over to mainframe operation!<br/>We can't operate it from here.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reeve</b><br/>What about the mainframe? Who!?</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He turns to Heidegger.</p>
<p class="block-inline">Hey, call the mainframe!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Heidegger</b><br/>Huh? Why are you giving orders?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reeve</b><br/>I don't give a damn about the details!!</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">At the Sister Ray's controls...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b><br/>Ha, ha, ha...... Just you wait, Sephiroth.<br/>I'll give you all the Mako you want.</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p class="indent-nopad"><b>Reeve</b><br/>Hojo, STOP! The cannon, no, Midgar itself is in danger!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b><br/>Ha, ha, ha...... One or two Midgars? ...it's a small price to pay.</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p class="indent-nopad"><b>Reeve</b><br/>Hojo! HOJO......!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b><br/>Show me...... Sephiroth.<br/>It should be near...<br/>Ha, ha, ha...... Go beyond the powers of science...<br/>Before your presence, science is powerless...<br/>I hate it, but I'll concede to it.<br/>Just... let me see it.<br/>Ha, ha, ha......</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">Back on the Highwind...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>YO! Do somethin'! Ya big cat!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>We're sunk. Hojo's doing this on his own......<br/>...? ...? H, huh!?<br/>I don't like this......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>You're busted, Reeve!<br/>Too late tryin' to hide it now...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Can't you stop the Mako reactor?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>......We can't stop it.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>............</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>We came a long way to get here. You better not double-cross us now!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>I can't make you trust me......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>You damn fool! Don't you understand anything I'm saying?<br/>I don't give a damn about Shinra. If you're a man... no, if you're a human being, you'll save the planet! Don't you even care?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>No way! If we shut down the reactor, all hell will break loose!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Why? Can't you just shut off the valve?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>Yeah, it's easy to shut off the reactor's pipe valves......<br/>But the reactor made a path for the energy to escape from below.<br/>Once you open that, it'll be impossible to close it until everything blasts out...<br/>And we can't try to stop the energy from gushing out......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>An explosion!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>This blast'll be way stronger than when the number 1 reactor blew up!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Damn...!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>Forget about that......... the CANNON! We've got to get to Midgar! That's the first thing!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Must stop Hojo... first.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">At Shinra HQ...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reeve</b><br/>Looks like Cloud and the others are on their way. Stay out of the way!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Heidegger</b><br/>Ghaa haah hah hah!<br/>Don't be so ludicrous! I don't recall you giving me any orders!<br/>The Peace Preservation will give their best effort to make the enemy retreat!<br/>Because of them, I...... I...!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reeve</b><br/>That's a private matter......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Heidegger</b><br/>The President is dead! Now I'm doing things my way!<br/>Ghaa haah hah hah!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>Ha, ha, ha.<br/>Heidegger! Now I'm going to use the new weapon!</p>
<p class="italic">Two Shinra soldiers run in to restrain Reeve. Scarlet and Heidegger leave the Conference Room.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reeve</b><br/>Hey! Wait!!<br/>Cloud, everybody! Sorry......<br/>But!!</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="descent"></a>Back on the Highwind...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>But!<br/>But you'll come, won't you!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I know!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Hey!<br/>I'm leaving the ship in your hands!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Pilot</b><br/>I'm heading for Midgar!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Comin' and goin'... gettin' pushed around.<br/>But I got a debt to all them back in Midgar that I can't never repay...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>It's all right.<br/>You're here... Everyone's all together<br/>Together... we can do anything. We've worked this hard already.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>I wonder why Hojo performed so many of these experiments?<br/>Why couldn't he content himself with quiet research?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>I can't 'pologize to y'all enough.<br/>If I was just a bit more o' a better feller Ain't none of this woulda happened...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>Hojo... what a queer fellow.<br/>Such utter lack of scientific talent... compared with the genius of Dr. Gast......<br/>Lucrecia chose him trying to protect him...<br/>Now I understand... I understand... but...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>We're busy runnin' back and forth!<br/>Even my bikini goddess would be pantin' about now!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>Headed for... Midgar?<br/>Uh, a, anywhere's fine... I don't care. Just hurry up and land this thing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Learner Pilot (LV14 Limit Break!)</b><br/>Yo, Cloud! Whacha gonna do?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Move it!<br/>- Wait</p>
<p class="italic">They fly back to Midgar.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Pilot</b><br/>We've reached Midgar!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Even if we get there, Midgar's under martial law!<br/>There'll be no way we could slip into the slums.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Looks like all transportation from the slums is cut off......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Hey, hey, whaddya think we have Highwind for?<br/>Where are we now!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Huh? Where are we...?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>If land's no go... We'll go by air!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Okay then! We'll parachute into Midgar!!</p>
<p class="italic">Everyone runs off to the deck.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Here we go!!</p>
<p class="italic">They all jump off the Highwind and parachute into Midgar, landing in 8th Street, Sector 8.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>Heidegger is going after you all.<br/>That's why it's dangerous out there. Let's go underground!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud joins the others around an entrance to the Sector 8 underground.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Sounds strange comin' from me...<br/>But it feels like home bein' back in Midgar.<br/>Kinda makes me sick...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>We sure got to know the Midgar underground.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>I have an old score to settle with Hojo, so let's hurry and go!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>This place smells gross. Let's get this over with!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Yeah! Let's get it over with!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>So it was Hojo who stirred up all this commotion, after all these years...?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>This is where we go in.<br/>Please! Hurry and come to the Mako Cannon!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud and the others make their way through the underground and reach the train tunnel. If Cloud travels backwards down the tunnel instead of ahead, he first comes across Barret.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Leave this to me! Hurry to the cannon!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He starts firing towards their rear.</p>
<p class="italic">Going back far enough, Cloud will reach a dead end with the W-Item materia.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Dead end!</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="turks"></a>Going forward again, eventually the Turks will intercept Cloud.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elena</b><br/>Oh no! They're here!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud and the others turn to face her as Reno and Rude walk up.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elena</b><br/>What are we going to do!? I think it's okay for you to ignore your orders now.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reno</b><br/>...Elena, don't act so weak.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Rude</b><br/>We're Turks, Elena.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elena</b><br/>...Yes, sir. You're right.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Rude</b><br/>Come on, we've got work to do.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Reno</b><br/>I'm not really up for it, but...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elena</b><br/>Our orders were to seek you out and...<br/>...Kill.<br/>Our company may be in turmoil, but an order's an order.<br/>That's the will and spirit of the Turks! Believe it!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elena</b><br/>What are you doing! Let's go!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Okay, let's end this<br/>- No, let's not go</p>
<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">Okay, let's end this</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Reno</b><br/>I know we have a weird relationship, but...<br/>We have to end this... like Turks!</p>
  <p class="italic">A battle ensues.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Elena</b> (attacking)<br/>Try this on for size!</p>
  <p class="italic">Cloud and the others attack her.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Elena</b><br/>Yeow! That hurts!<br/>Take THAT!!</p>
  <p class="italic-inline-nopad">She casts Infatuation.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Rude</b><br/>............</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Reno</b><br/>Let's call it a day.</p>
  <p class="italic">They flee.</p>

<div class="block"/>
  <p><span class="highlight">No, let's not go</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Elena</b><br/>You showing pity!? Don't take the Turks for fools!</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Reno</b><br/>Wait, Elena.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Elena</b><br/>Reno! You're not violating the order... are you!?</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Reno</b><br/>Shinra's finished. It's come down to this.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Rude</b><br/>......</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Elena</b><br/>Rude...</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Reno</b><br/>Elena, you were a great Turk!</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Elena</b><br/>......</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Reno</b><br/>Farewell. If we both survive...<br/>If we can save our lives...</p>
  <p class="italic-inline-nopad">He walks off.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Elena</b><br/>Remember the spirit of the Turks...!</p>
  <p class="italic-inline-nopad">She salutes and runs off.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Rude</b><br/>Our mission's finished...</p>
  <p class="italic-inline-nopad">He follows the others.</p>

<p class="italic">Cloud and the others move on. At the first branch in the tunnel, they find Yuffie.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon---!</p>
<p class="italic">At the next is Cid.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Which way...!?<br/>Goddamn, piece of $#@^% cannon!!</p>
<p class="italic">Going left takes them to the Shinra building.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>No, no! The Sister Ray's not this way!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud retraces his steps to find the right path, finding Tifa crouched down on the tracks. She stands.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>I'm all right! Hurry and go to the cannon!</p>
<p class="italic">Eventually Cloud comes out in the streets of Sector 8 again, near the supports for the cannon. They head for the stairs, but the ground starts shaking, and they stop and look back.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>What the... hell is that!!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>This can't be...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>Are you serious...?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>......!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Hey-hey! You serious...?</p>
<p class="italic">The hatch of the huge mecha opens.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Heidegger</b><br/>G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! Here they come!<br/>G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! So they really showed up!<br/>You sure did treat us like dogs up to now!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>You killed off a lot of my precious soldiers!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Heidegger</b><br/>G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! But let's see how you do against anti-Weapon artillery!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>You guys are worthless, but my proud creation is a sure thing!</p>
<p class="italic">They go back inside the hatch.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>I'll show you the destructive power of the Proud Clod!</p>
<p class="italic">A battle ensues, and they defeat the Proud Clod.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Scarlet</b><br/>Not that! This is the proud Clod.........!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Heidegger</b><br/>Whoooooa!!</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="hojo"></a>The Proud Clod explodes. It starts to rain, and Cloud and the others move on down the street and start up the stairs to the Sister Ray.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>This way, Cloud!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b> (on a lower platform, watching)<br/>Damn! Hojo...!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Hey! This is...</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p>Received "Missing Score"!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>This is great. Hold on, Hojo......!</p>
<p class="italic">They reach Hojo, who is working at the cannon's controls.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Hojo! Stop right there!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b><br/>Oh... the failure.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>At least remember my name! It's Cloud!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b><br/>Every time I see you, I...<br/>It pains me that I had so little scientific sense...<br/>I evaluated you as a failed project.<br/>But, you are the only one that succeeded as a Sephiroth-clone.<br/>Heh, heh, heh...... I'm even beginning to hate myself.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>None of that matters... just stop this nonsense!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b> (pausing)<br/>...nonsense?<br/>Oh, this?</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He turns around.</p>
<p class="block-inline">Ha, ha, ha...<br/>Sephiroth seems to be counting on the energy.<br/>So I'm going to lend him a hand.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Why!? Why do that!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b><br/>Quit asking me why, you moron.<br/>Hmm... actually, you might be cut out to be a scientist.</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He turns back to the controls.</p>
<p class="block-inline">Energy level is at...... 83%. It's taking too long.<br/>My son is in need of power and help. ...That's the only reason.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Sephiroth is your son!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>......!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b><br/>Ha, ha, ha...<br/>I offered the woman with my child to Professor Gast's Jenova Project.<br/>When Sephiroth was still in the womb, we took the cells of Jenova...<br/>HA, HA, HA!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>You......!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I can't believe you're the one who did this...<br/>The illusionary crime against Sephiroth...</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b><br/>Heee, hee, hee, hee! No you're wrong!<br/>It's my desire as a scientist! Heee, hee, hee, hee!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>......<br/>I was...wrong. The one that should have slept was...<br/>...You, Hojo!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b><br/>I... was defeated by my desire to become a scientist.<br/>I lost the last time as well.<br/>I've injected Jenova's cells into my own body!<br/>Heee, hee, hee!<br/>Here are...<br/>Heee, hee, hee!<br/>...my results!!</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Hojo</b><br/>Gwah, haw, haw!!<br/>Haw... now let's see<br/>how the Mako juice is reacting?</p>
<p class="italic">Hojo morphs into Helletic Hojo, and later into Lifeform Hojo. Cloud and the others manage to defeat him.</p>
