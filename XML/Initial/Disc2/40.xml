<p class="italic">While roaming the ocean in the submarine, Cloud and the others come across Lucrecia's cave.</p>
<p class="italic">If Vincent is not in the party...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucrecia</b><br/>Vincent...</p>
<p class="italic">The altar is vacant, and Cloud turns to go.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucrecia</b><br/>Sephiroth...</p>
<p class="italic">Returning with Vincent in the party, Lucrecia will randomly say one name or the other...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucrecia</b><br/>Sephiroth... | Vincent...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>That voice? It can't be...</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He steps forward.</p>
<p class="block-inline">Lucrecia...?</p>
<p class="italic">Lucrecia is standing at the altar, and she turns around upon hearing his voice.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucrecia</b><br/>Vincent......?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b> (running towards her)<br/>Lucrecia!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucrecia</b><br/>Stay back!</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p class="italic">There follows a sequence of flashbacks. Scene one: Vincent, as a Turk, and three scientists (Gast, Hojo, and Lucrecia) walk into the Shinra mansion. Vincent pauses near the gate to look up at the sky.<br/><br/>

Scene three: At Nibelheim's gate, Vincent is holding both of Lucrecia's hands in his. She breaks away and runs off.<br/><br/>
Scene four: Lucrecia is in Hojo's arms, and Vincent is watching. He turns away, sighs, then runs off.</p>
<p class="block-grey">If she is happy then... I don't mind.</p>
<p class="italic">Scene five: Lucrecia is sitting in a chair, stroking her belly.</p>
<p class="italic">Scene six: Hojo, Lucrecia, and Vincent are in the basement. Lucrecia looks ashamed, while the other two are angry.</p>
<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Vincent</b><br/>I'm against it!! Why experiments on humans!?</p>
<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Hojo</b><br/>She and I are both scientists!!</p>
<p class="block-grey">After that, a child was born to Lucrecia...<br/>That child's name is...<br/>Sephiroth......</p>
<p class="italic">Scene seven: Lucrecia collapses on the floor in the inn.<br/><br/>
Scene eight: Vincent runs down to the basement, making angry gestures at Hojo. Hojo runs his hands through his hair, then shoots Vincent, who crumples to the floor.<br/><br/>
Scene nine: Hojo stands over Vincent at the basement's operating table.<br/><br/>
Scene ten: Vincent gets up from Hojo's operating table and looks at his hands.</p>
<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Vincent</b><br/>Urrrrrrrrrrgh!</p>
<p class="block-grey">This body is... the punishment that's been given to me.<br/>I was unable...to stop Professor Gast and Hojo...<br/>And Lucrecia...I was unable to stop them.<br/>All that I was able to do was watch... That is my punishment...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>Lucrecia... You're alive...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucrecia</b><br/>I wanted to disappear... I couldn't be with anyone... I wanted to die...<br/>But the Jenova inside me wouldn't let me die...<br/>Lately, I dream a lot of Sephiroth... My dear, dear child.<br/>Ever since he was born I never got to hold him, even once...<br/>Not even once. You can't call me his mother... That... is my sin...</p>
<p class="italic">Vincent starts forward.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucrecia</b><br/>Back!! Stay back!<br/>Vincent... Won't you please tell me?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>......What?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucrecia</b><br/>If Sephiroth is still alive?<br/>I heard that he died five years ago. But I see him in my dreams so often...<br/>And I know that physically, like myself, he can't die so easily.<br/>Please, Vincent tell me......</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud starts forward, but Vincent holds out an arm to silence him.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>Lucrecia... Sephiroth is dead...</p>
<p class="italic">They leave the cave.</p>
