<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>Listen to me! Something really big's happening in Midgar.<br/>They were just saying on TV it was Rufus second strategy and...<br/>That big cannon's pointed due north...... You think the target's...... Sephiroth?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>Sephiroth put up a huge barrier around the North Crater.<br/>Rufus wants to use a mammoth cannon to smash the barrier.<br/>He plans to have Shinra troops rush in and attack Sephiroth after the barrier falls.</p>
<p class="italic">Inside the second house...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Old Man</b><br/>Everyone at Shinra's in an uproar because they heard Weapon's coming.<br/>I heard a big hydroplane carrying secret weapons, got attacked by Weapon and was sunk at sea......</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="junon"></a>At Lower Junon...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Woman</b><br/>I heard a war's about to start! And that's why they're moving the big cannon!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Older Man</b><br/>Listen Cloud, I'm over the hill, but Priscilla is still a child.<br/>Isn't there a way to protect at least her from Meteor?</p>
<p class="italic">In Upper Junon...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier</b><br/>The Shinra Army's gathered at Midgar. Now it's just a matter of time Sephiroth's dead.<br/>What... me? I don't mind. I'll just wait here. My life is important to me.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="costa"></a>At Costa del Sol...</p>
<p class="italic">Johnny's House...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Johnny</b><br/>No, no, NO!! Meteor's getting bigger by the minute!!<br/>I wanna live on the edge right now! I want to build a home with my woman and grow old together!<br/>If you can't do it, I will! And that's that!<br/>I'm gonna do my best, so you hang in there, too!</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="corel"></a>At North Corel...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man in Hardhat</b><br/>Hey, the Gold Saucer reopened!<br/>We've got to play hard to get our minds of Meteor.</p>
<p class="italic">At the ropeway station...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>I'm gonna use all my life savings before Meteor hits!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Blond</b><br/>I know how you feel, but what if Meteor doesn't hit us? What are you gonna do then?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Station Man</b><br/>The Gold Saucer reopened. Why don't you go play hard and clear your heads as well as your pockets?</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="gold"></a>At Gold Saucer...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Dio</b><br/>I thought about it, but there was only one conclusion.<br/>I believed that because of the way things are, there's a need for a place like this.<br/>Enjoy yourselves... Ha ha ha ha...</p>
<p class="italic">By this point, Cloud may be able to access the special duel at the Battle Arena.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Receptionist</b><br/>You know, I've been thinking about it for a while now, but you must be pretty strong?<br/>Probably strong enough to take on the top 1 or 2 fighters?<br/>Maybe you'll be good enough for the big match......<br/>How 'bout it? There's a private battle only for the strongest. Wanna try?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Let's do it<br/>- Not interested</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Woman Outside Battle Square</b><br/>I watched you win eight battles. I want you to have this!</p>
<div class="highlight"/><p>Received "Sprint Shoes"!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Woman Outside Battle Square</b><br/>Good luck in the future, too!</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="gongaga"></a>At Gongaga...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Old Man</b><br/>Shinra's tried a lot of things, but it's only HUMAN. It's fate that Meteor will kill the people.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>...Everyone's going to die. Everything's coming to an end.</p>
