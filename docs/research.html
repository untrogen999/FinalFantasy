        <p>How can the main Final Fantasy VII characters' importance be measured through the number of times the character talks and number of times the character is talked about?</p>
        <p>This research question was chosen as it allows us to use our coding knowledge to understand the importance of each of the members of the party. For instance, Cloud may be notably more significant than another party member like Yuffie because he is the protagonist and not an unlockable character.</p>

        <p>Benjamin and Aeris worked together collaboratively and communicated with one another frequently for the duration of the project. Benjamin was more knowledgable with coding while Aeris was more knowledgable with the material itself.</p>
        <p>Benjamin was in charge of using XSL to transform the website to HTML, marking up the XML using RegEx, and creating the SVG graph. He also assisted Aeris with the more troublesome aspects of the website.</p>
        <p>Aeris was in charge of the Network Analysis via Cytoscape, writing up the RNC schema, and developing the HTML, SSI, and CSS for the website.</p>
